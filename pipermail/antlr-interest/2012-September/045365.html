&gt;<i> Kieran,

</I>&gt;<i> Which issues are these?
</I>
I was thinking of (in precedence order):

- Backtracking and labels (see 
<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2012-March/044216.html">http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2012-March/044216.html</A>). 
I started working on this but got stuck, then got project diverted. All 
the context is in the list thread and my code is at 
<A HREF="https://github.com/kierans/antlr3">https://github.com/kierans/antlr3</A>

- Gated semantic predicates for C walkers 
(<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2012-April/044387.html">http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2012-April/044387.html</A>). 
  However this may not be a bug as my question about gated semantic 
predicates in walkers throwing exceptions didn't get a reply (are GSP 
treated differently in walkers to parsers?)

- The last issue I was thinking about was more a feature request which I 
don't expect has been done due to time constraints and that's Tree 
Pattern Matchers 
(<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2012-August/045126.html">http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2012-August/045126.html</A>).

The first issue is a well known bug, the second may or may not be a bug, 
and the third as mentioned is a feature because it's just missing due to 
noone actually wanting it till now in the C target.

If anyone else who has worked on these issues has gotten them to work, 
it would be nice to have the code in the 3.5 release.  If not, oh well. 
  I'm not trying to bag Jim out here BTW, without his efforts for the C 
target my project would be a bit stuffed as I think Antlr is the best of 
breed tool, and I can't use Java as an implementation language. So I 
personally really appreciate his efforts.

Cheers,

&gt;<i> I have &quot;fixed&quot; the couple of (release-phase) issues that have been
</I>&gt;<i> affecting my usage of the C target.

</I>&gt;<i> You can find my patches on GitHub: <A HREF="https://github.com/stephengaito/antlr3">https://github.com/stephengaito/antlr3</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is essentially one patch on each of my branches. On my system, I
