<PRE>I think that the only potential issue with such things is that despite
their automation, someone has to look after them. I have no issue with
it myself, so long as it does not take a long time to set up but then
you have to convince Ter that there is no extra hassle for him. To be
honest for this kind of project I would just write some bash scripts and
use cron.

Hi,

 

The need to manage this sort of release reminds me that the project
would benefit from a Continuous Integration build environment. For one
thing it would encourage us (and others) to add more unit tests. For
another, daily (or even more frequent) builds of the depot HEAD would be
available with a report about tests passed/failed/ignored etc.

 

One option might be Cruise Control (since the existing server(s) can run
Java) and CruiseControl is a CI system built in Java. It can be massaged
to work with Nant (for C#) and CPP (Cpp links below):

I have none or little information about using CC to monitor/build

	There is a new distribution snapshot checked in which is labeled
3.0.1. This may change if Ter decides that the first bug fix release
will be called something completely different.

	 

	To use this, you also need to rebuild ANTLR or at least make it
pick up the latest C.stg.

	 

	This fixes:

	 

	-          All bugs that you lot know about ;-) - Mistyped MACRO
names, followSet problem, and all those problems that people moaned at
me for making them waste two hours on there are actually quite a number
of trivial little fixes in there too;

	-          Provides stacked streams so that they may be handled
trivially in lexers etc (see example of the C parser in the C examples,
which now caters for #include.)

	-          Corrects a couple of tree stream rewrite issues (one
is code gen, one was in the runtime);

	 

	I have not been able to extensively test this and remember this
is snapshot to see if bugs are fixed properly. If you had a bug and know
how to rebuild things then please try this out and let me know if you
still have issues. Please try to be polite - most people are J. I am
well aware of all the typos in my comments - I type at 2342342
characters a second and 98% are BS J and I will fix all those up at some
point so no need to send me things like that.

	 

	Share and Enjoy,

	 

	Jim
