<PRE>
I have no experience with DFA lexer construction.

Yes, the lookahead issues can be extremely tricky - they've caused me
confusion on several occasions, and it often took me a long time to figure
out what was going on.

The lexer that I had to build is a very miserable one, because it has macro
processing mixed right into it, and the macro processing is downright
psychotic. For example, I may have to do macro expansion or include file
expansion literally inside the middle of a token. It was very difficult to
build using Antlr's lexer construction, but for all I know, it may have
been much worse or even impossible to try to build with a DFA-based tool.

This may be completely off topic, but I have one other issue with lexer
construction, and that is a performance issue. For example, one of my
parser test runs, with profiling, showed that of the entire lex+parse, 18%
of the run was spent within a lexer comment rule! It spent so much time
there because I was unable to convince Antlr to generate code to first
process the most likely possibility within comments (any character other
than '*')... Antlr insisted on checking for &quot;*/&quot; first, and then processing
any other character. I don't know if a DFA-based tool would have been
better for this. Perhaps there's a way in Antlr that I don't know of to
force one check to be done prior to another. I worked around the issue by
coding the comment rule by hand, and there are other rules that I have my
eye on next for rewrites by hand.

Beyond that... I like the lexer construction. It's really nice to be able
to use the same Antlr syntax for lexer construction as for parser
construction.

My $.02.
John

</I>&gt;<i> INT : ('0'..'9')+ ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> FLOAT : ('0'..'9')+ ('.' ('0'..'9')*)? | '.' ('0'..'9')+ ;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> could be turned into a combine rule by the system:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> INT_FLOAT
</I>&gt;<i> 	:	('0'..'9')+ ('.' ('0'..'9')*)?
</I>&gt;<i> 	|	'.' ('0'..'9')+
</I>&gt;<i> 	;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> or whatever.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Still, my lookahead computations are really twisted for lexical rules 
</I>&gt;<i> when you can see past end of a rule--literally any character can follow 
</I>&gt;<i> a token (if you consider erroneous input).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ANYWAY, who has thoughts on this?  I'd like thoughts also from people
