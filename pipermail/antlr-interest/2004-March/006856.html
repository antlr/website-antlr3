<PRE>What I'm doing at the moment, is trying to get the basics of my grammar
in place. Precedence of mathematical operations. How do you lex (and
parse) the difference between an array and a function-reference (I know
- treat an array as if it's a function :-). How do you parse a token
when semantics depends on syntax?

(My example is, for example, &quot;a = b &lt; c&quot; and &quot;a = b &lt; c &gt;&quot;. The former
is a logical comparison, the latter is using &lt;&gt; as a special sort of
array-reference parenthesis. Monty knows *exactly* what I'm talking
about :-)

Parsing &quot;if then else&quot; constructs, and those damn ambiguity warnings! I
feel pressured to treat EOL as white space, but especially with &quot;if then
else&quot;, they are actually syntactically crucial ...

I've come across various references to emitters, but have yet to come
across one. I'm trying to write a tree parser that emits object code.
Severely hampered by my lack of knowledge of Java :-)

Don't worry about any of this at the moment, but if I can get this
*functionally* complete, with 90% of the keywords missing, then I think
it would make a very good, simple, teaching grammar. My thinking is
strongly influenced by the Prime FTN compiler which, when I saw how it
worked, about all it did was convert my complex source into a symbol
table and bunch of CALL statements, using them to do almost everything
even down to the &quot;assign a variable&quot; level! By leaving out 99% of the
instances of &quot;convert language statement to function call&quot; we'll end up
with a grammar that is almost 100% teaching material and very little
repetition. Consisting of a lexer, parser, and treeparse/emitter :-)

Cheers,
Wol

Hi Anthony,

As monty said, it'd be great to get a list of those questions... Can  
you summarize your thoughts?  I promise to use them appropriately even  
if it takes me a bit.

Have you seen the &quot;add C++ style templates to Java&quot; USF CS652 project  
with solution?  That could be useful.  There are a number of projects  
and labs on my USF site that perhaps are not visible enough.

Have you seen the really cool PS interpreter and viewer lab?  All my  
labs are bite-size chunks designed to be finished in 1:45.  There is a  
cool byte-code interpreter lab as well.  Have you checked these out?   
See my next email about the new project. :)
