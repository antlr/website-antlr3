In Java, there are two severe limitations to the ability of primitives. First, the language doesn't allow user-defined primitives, so there is no concept of lightweight enums, aggregate data structures, or the ability to create special struct based on an int that has special meaning with no more overhead than the int itself (say for a special application-specific type of bitfield, or distinguishing a platform-width integer from a memory address/pointer stored in a platform-width integer). Second, generics such as ArrayList&lt;T&gt; in Java are only handled specially by the compiler. At runtime, the storage used inside the list forces boxing/unboxing of values. Arrays of primitives (like int[] a) are able to hold unboxed values, so they are lighter.

This is exactly the things I wish to address in my language.  It will have features of Java but I found that

final int a = 10; is not a sufficient or efficient way to do enums.  Also, when I first started programming in Java
I didn't know there weren't aggregate types.  I had never experience that, so I went on a mad hunt trying
to figure out how to create a struct. Its funny now, but it wasn't funny then.  Combining features of one language
with the features of another along with the addition of your own ideas seems like a good way to go.

I'll look into Android.  I'm curious now.  Its challenging for me to understand how the folks at Google could make
a loser (big mistakes) like the one you refer to after having so many winners.

While this is somewhat true of Java, it's really not true of C#. The built-in primitive types in both languages (int, short, double, char, bool) are passed by value in function calls and kept on the stack as local variables. The process of boxing in both languages takes a primitive type and wraps it as an object on the heap, as required for an operation like the following. The process of unboxing (also shown) converts it back to a primitive.

object o = 3;
int i = (int)o;

In Java, there are two severe limitations to the ability of primitives. First, the language doesn't allow user-defined primitives, so there is no concept of lightweight enums, aggregate data structures, or the ability to create special struct based on an int that has special meaning with no more overhead than the int itself (say for a special application-specific type of bitfield, or distinguishing a platform-width integer from a memory address/pointer stored in a platform-width integer). Second, generics such as ArrayList&lt;T&gt; in Java are only handled specially by the compiler. At runtime, the storage used inside the list forces boxing/unboxing of values. Arrays of primitives (like int[] a) are able to hold unboxed values, so they are lighter.

C# shows heavy advantages in several areas by hitting these issues square on the head. First, enums are as lightweight as ints, so using them is an encouraged, zero-overhead practice. Second, careful use of structs, C#'s way of creating user-defined unboxed values, leads to immense performance benefits in places like embedded computing, systems programming, high-performance applications, and even cases like my high-performance SlimLexer for ANTLR's C# port that operates 5x faster than Lexer in 1/5 the memory (I sent an email to antlr-dev mailing list about this). Third, when a generic type is instantiated at runtime with a value type (like List&lt;int&gt;), the JIT actually produces code that operates fully on unboxed values, in cases allowing performance rivaling C++ templates. These advantages are one of the reasons I believe Google's use of Java for the Android platform was an unacceptable mistake, a failure to meet the fundamental requirements of their clients as well as they could. It is the responsibility of development teams to not make decisions like they did knowing full well it will result in a crippled end-user experience.
