<i>Terence Parr</i>

<p>

This entry leads you through the development of a simple parser for
reading in name/age pairs.  You'll see how to use

<ul>
<li>(...)+ loop to match sequences of characters and tokens. 
<li>Access token objects via labeling elements. 
<li>Have the lexer ignore whitespace and track line numbers. 
</ul>

<p>
You will print out the contents of an input file in a certain
format.  The input is:

<tt><pre>
Griffin 2
Terence 33
Karen   31
Tom     32
Pat     26
</pre></tt>

<B>Parsing</B>

<p>
A grammar to recognize a sequence of name/age pairs is pretty simple.
Define a grammar class derived from <CODE>Parser</CODE> to indicate
you will be recognizing token streams (not characters or tree nodes).

<tt><pre>
class P extends Parser;

// match one-or-more 'name followed by age' pairs
startRule
    :   ( NAME AGE )+
    ;
</pre></tt>

<p>
We will define the references to <CODE>NAME</CODE> and <CODE>AGE</CODE>
later, but for now assume they represent a series of letters and a series of
digits, respectively.  Also assume whitespace is ignored.

<p>
It's probably worth mentioning at this point that tools such as awk and PERL
work on a line by line basis, not character by character.  Hence, you could
write a quick parser to read name/age pairs <B>if</B> they happen to be
consistently on a line together or on separate lines.  Here is a quick
awk invocation that works if the data is on one line:

<tt><pre>
awk '{print "("$1","$2")"}' &lt; input
</pre></tt>

<p>
Unfortunately, it will print "(,)" for empty lines at the end also.

<p>
A real parser,
on the other hand, looks only at a stream of vocabulary symbols (tokens);
they generally ignore whitespace unless it is part of the vocabulary such
as in Python or make (tabs count--ick).  Anyway, "right tool for the right
job" etc...

<p>
Grammar <CODE>P</CODE> recognizes name/age sequences, but does nothing with them.
In other words, no output is generated.  Let's extend the grammar to generate
output in the form of "(name,age)".  In order to access the attributes of an
input token, label the token reference, which gives you a token object
that you can manipulate with standard methods such as <CODE>getText</CODE>.
A simple <CODE>System.out.println</CODE> method call generates the desired
output:

<tt><pre>
class P extends Parser;

// match one-or-more 'name followed by age' pairs
startRule
    :   (   n:NAME a:AGE
            {System.out.println("("+n.getText()+","+a.getText()+")");}
        )+
    ;
</pre></tt>

<B>Lexical Analysis</B>

<p>
A parser applies a grammatical structure to a sequence of input tokens,
but where do the input tokens come from?  From a beast called a <I>lexical
analyzer</I> or <I>lexer</I> that scans the input characters looking for
patterns.  [<i>Sounds like a parser doesn't it?  It is, but lexers
parse characters
not tokens.  ANTLR treats lexical analysis, parsing, and tree parsing as
simply variations on recognition.  This generalization provides a pleasing
notational consistency across recognizer types.</i>]

<p>
To define a vocabulary of tokens, create another grammar class, but
this time derive it from <CODE>Lexer</CODE> and then create a rule
for each token:

<tt><pre>
// Lexer framework (rule contents are missing here)
class L extends Lexer;

NAME:   ... ;

AGE :   ... ;

WS  :   ... ;   // white space, which will be ignored
</pre></tt>

To match any character in a range, use the range operator;
for example, <CODE>'0'..'9'</CODE> matches a digit.
Therefore, to match a series of
digits, we can embed the range in the <CODE>(...)+</CODE>
positive closure (one-or-more) block or "loop".  <CODE>AGE</CODE>
can then be completely specified as:

<tt><pre>
// match a decimal age of any length
AGE :   ( '0'..'9' )+
    ;
</pre></tt>

Similarly, <CODE>NAME</CODE> can be specified as:

<tt><pre>
// match an upper/lower case name of any length
NAME:   ( 'a'..'z' | 'A'..'Z' )+
    ;
</pre></tt>

The alternative operator '<CODE>|</CODE>' is used to indicate
that either range can be matched.  Each time through the loop
the lexer will match either a lowercase or an uppercase letter.

<p>
Whitespace such as tab, space, and newline is very often ignored
by parsers.  Rather than have the parser try to match and ignore
whitespace tokens everywhere, it is customary for the lexer to
match and throw out whitespace.  Ignoring whitespace in the lexer
is a matter of specifying what constitutes whitespace and then
setting the token type for that token to be a special value:
<CODE>Token.SKIP</CODE>.  Use ANTLR-action method
<CODE>$setType</CODE> to set the token type.  In the following
rule, you'll note that rather than a <CODE>$setType</CODE> on
each alternative, we grouped the alternatives and placed a single
action at the end.

<tt><pre>
WS  :   (   ' '
        |   '\t'
        |   '\r' '\n' { newline(); }
        |   '\n'      { newline(); }
        )
        {$setType(Token.SKIP);} //ignore this token
    ;
</pre></tt>

The Lexer has a predefined notion of newline or carriage return that
is used in both the lexer and the parser for error handling and by
user actions.  A standard method <CODE>newline</CODE> can be called
to increment the current line number.

<p>
This concludes both the parser and lexer.  Easy, right?  Put them
both in the same file called <CODE>t.g</CODE> and run ANTLR on
it to generate the implementation Java files:

<tt><pre>
$ java antlr.Tool t.g
ANTLR Parser Generator   Version 2.20   1997 MageLang Institute
</pre></tt>

To invoke the parser, a main program such as the following suffices:

<tt><pre>
import java.io.*;
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            L lexer = new L(new DataInputStream(System.in));
            P parser = new P(lexer);
            parser.startRule();
        } catch(Exception e) {
            System.err.println("exception: "+e);
        }
    }
}
</pre></tt>

<p>
Compile everything and run the input file through the program
as standard input.  You should get something similar to the
following:

<tt><pre>
$ javac *.java
$ java Main &lt; input
(Griffin,2)
(Terence,33)
(Karen,31)
(Tom,32)
(Pat,26)
$ 
</pre></tt>

<B>Conclusion</B>

<p>
This Field Guide entry demonstrates all of the basic elements
needed to build a typical parser and lexer.  Future entries
are more terse, but develop more complicated and useful recognizers
and translators.
