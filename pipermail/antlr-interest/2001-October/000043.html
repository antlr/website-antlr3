You're doing something wrong then ;) I use the same setup daily without
problem. Maybe manually add a bit of code to your lexer and see what's in
the map? Are you using caseSensitive or caseSensitiveLiterals or both? What
are the exact options you feed to antlr?

Or maybe did you define the DROP token in your parser and not in the lexer?
This would explain why it works with lexer and parser in one file. If you
use exportvocab make sure you define *all* tokens in the lexer. In the
parser you can safely add new imaginary AST tokens but *no* lexer tokens.
Since how would the lexer know about them? (ok this could be fixed but
antlr doesn't work that way now)

</I>&gt;<i> So may be bug in ANTLR...may be I have made something wrong, but what ?
</I>
The import/export vocab options and lexer and parser in one/separate
file(s) is a nice thing to get right. The docs are a bit cryptic on this
point look in the archives for a complete and exhaustive discussion of the
topic. Behaviour of antlr is quite different in both cases (something I'm
lobbying against).

Hmmm I see I was not 100% correct in my previous mail... Think I have some
cleaning up to do with respect to casesensitivity.

  of course, we ... that is ... well, yes, in fact,' said Ponder. 'Adrian

     technical way,' he added. --- From: Hogfather by Terry Pratchett.
