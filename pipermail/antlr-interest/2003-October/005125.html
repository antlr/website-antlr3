<PRE>Micheal,

Thanks, this allows my project to proceed. If I have any problems, I
will post them here. I was really worried I would lose access to ANTLR
in .Net. Java is nice, but my tools have to run on .Net or no one is
interested in them. Such is my world.

Thanks,

Mike

Mike,

The C# and J# distributions aren't equivalent, they are different tools.


The C# distribution contains a code generator that is a part of the
ANTLR tool[1*] that enables the generation of Lexers, Parsers and
TreeParsers in C#. It also contains a .NET/CLR runtime library that
all such ANTLR-generated code needs to compile and execute properly.

The J# Project distribution is a project file for Visual Studio.NET
and some instructions that allows a recompile/port of the ANTLR tool
to J# (a Java compiler that generates code for the .NET/CLR platform).
This produces an executable version of the ANTLR that runs directly on
.NET/CLR without any need for Java[2*]. Hence the J# distribution
_needs_ the source to ANTLR including the code generator component
from the C# distribution.

So, to answer your implied question, you will need the following to be
able to use ANTLR in a Java-less environment:

1. The J# binary distro - for the tool executable
2. The stock ANTLR v2.7.2 distro
3. The ANTLR/C# update distro

(1) is the the ANTLR executable for .NET/CLR
(2) and (3) together allow you to build the ANTLR/C# .NET runtime
library

If you need to rebuild the ANTLR tool executable for the .NET platform
(i.e. 1), you will need a copy of J#, the J# Project distro and some
knowledge of Java &amp; J# of course.

Cheers,

Micheal

[1*]   The ANTLR tool is the command-line app that generates your
Lexer/Parser/TreeParser when fed an approriate grammar file. It is
written in Java.
on of the C# bits.

[2*]   This is of course the ANTLR 2.7.2 .NET executable on the site.
