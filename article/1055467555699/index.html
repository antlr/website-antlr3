<i>Terence Parr</i>

<p>
<p>
This Field Guide entry leads you through the development and execution of your
first ANTLR parser and lexer.  Follow these steps to achieve Nirvana:

<ol>
<li>
Create a new file, <tt>t.g</tt>, and cut-n-paste in the following grammar.

<tt><pre>
class P extends Parser;

startRule
    :   n:NAME
        {System.out.println("Hi there, "+n.getText());}
    ;

class L extends Lexer;

// one-or-more letters followed by a newline
NAME:   ( 'a'..'z'|'A'..'Z' )+ NEWLINE
    ;

NEWLINE
    :   '\r' '\n'   // DOS
    |   '\n'        // UNIX
    ;
</pre></tt>

<p>
The file does not need to end in ".g", but it is an ANTLR convention.  Make sure
your editor saves it as a text file.  You can place this grammar file anywhere
on your disk that you want, but it makes sense to have a directory for each
Field Guide entry you complete.  The next step assumes that the file is called "t.g"
and that your current working directory is the one containing "t.g".

<p>
<li>
Have ANTLR process the grammar file from the command line with:

<tt><pre>
java antlr.Tool t.g
</pre></tt>

<p>
ANTLR will generate:
<ul>
<li>L.java<br>  The lexical analyzer (Lexer).
<li>P.java<br>  The Parser.
<li>PTokenTypes.java<br> The <em>token type</em> definitions (integer constants).
The Lexer
breaks up the input stream of characters into vocabulary symbols called tokens,
which are identified by <em>token types</em>.
<li>PTokenTypes.txt<br>  A file containing all the token types that ANTLR can
easily read back in if a parser in another file wants to use the vocabulary,
lexer, or parser defined in <CODE>t.g</CODE>.  You can look at this as a
persistence file.
</ul>

<p>
<li>
Create a file called "Main.java" that contains the following Java code:

<tt><pre>
import java.io.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            L lexer = new L(new DataInputStream(System.in));
            P parser = new P(lexer);
            parser.startRule();
        } catch(Exception e) {
            System.err.println("exception: "+e);
        }
    }
}
</pre></tt>

<p>
This main program creates a lexer, L, that reads input from standard
input and then creates a parser, P, attached to that lexer.  To begin
parsing, the parser startRule method (resulting from the startRule grammar
rule) is called.
<p>
Any parser exceptions such as MismatchedToken will be caught by the "catch"
block and an error will be printed.

<p>
<li>
Compile the output of ANTLR from the command line with:

<tt><pre>
javac *.java
</pre></tt>

<p>
<li>
Run the resulting parser, Main, as you would any Java program.  Here is
a complete transcript from parser build through execution:

<tt><pre>
<i>on a DOS computer</i>:
c:\> java antlr.Tool t.g
