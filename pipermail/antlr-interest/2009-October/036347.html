<PRE>Here is the complete grammar:

 

grammar Test;

 

q             :               a ((b)=&gt;NOWAY | /*nothing*/);

 

a              :               'asd';

b             :               'qwe';

 

fragment NOWAY:          ;

 

 

'q' will accept &quot;asd&quot; but not &quot;asdqwe&quot;. Am I missing something?

 

 

BTW, if you can post a simplified example of your exact problem, you might
get more elegant solutions. This is only a hack for the specific problem you
posted. Maybe your original problem can be solved in a more elegant way.
Cases that require hacks of this kind are very rare and arises only while
parsing some very obscure languages. 

 

Cheers, Indhu

Yikes, that doesn't seem to work, it seems to give a normal positive
predicate for me. (Or something). But not &quot;if a not followed by b&quot; =&gt; a.

 

?

The other say I replied from my ipod and was not able to test it with ANTLR.
I checked it now and the code doesn't work for me too. However you can try a
variant:

 

q             :               a ((b)=&gt;NOWAY | /*nothing*/)

                ;

 

fragment NOWAY

                :               ;

 

This is tested J But note that this is only a hack and use it only when
there is no other alternative. 

 

Going by your &quot;one of my &quot;smaller&quot; rules is &quot;consuming&quot; something that
should belong to a &quot;larger&quot; rule&quot; description, it looks like you can solve
that problem by turning off greedy. Grep for 'greedy' in the book or wiki.

 

Cheers, Indhu

Jim, being new to predicates I realised soon after this that you were
talking about token lookaheads. And yes I do need a syntactic lookahead (but
thas is negative). In beginner-speak, one of my &quot;smaller&quot; rules is
&quot;consuming&quot; something that should belong to a &quot;larger&quot; rule. This would be
correct if that particular something (e.g. &quot;a&quot;) was *not* followed by a
syntactic construct conforming to &quot;b&quot;. Hence (a !b)=&gt;a (for the smaller
rule) seems the simplest solution to this to me. Is Indhu's version correct
for doing this trick? It doesn't seem to work for me (but I might be doing
something else wrong). If not correct, what is the correct way? My target is
Java.

2009/10/5 Jim Idle &lt;<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest">jimi at temporal-wave.com</A>&gt;

Use a semantic predicate rather than syntactic. You possibly need a bated
predicate here too:

 

{ input.LA(1) == A &amp;&amp; input.LA(2) != B}?=&gt;

 

However, if you need that kind of syntactic predicate, then I suggest you
may be approaching your problem incorrectly.

 

Jim

If I do

 

(a ~b)=&gt; a

 

meaning &quot;take this alternative if you encounter an a when not followed by b&quot;

 

I get a syntax error: unexpected token b

Is it the right syntax to use '~'?

 

N
