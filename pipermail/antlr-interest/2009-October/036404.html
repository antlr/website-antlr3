<PRE>Well, you could pay me to make an EBCDIC version ;) However, there is in practice no problem with mixing this &#8211; I have done it before on zOS.

 

I think that you need to look at this in the opposite light in that it isn&#8217;t that ANTLR code isn&#8217;t portable, but your lexer specification (and the fact that EBCDIC is stupid).

 

Why are you specifying your rule as:

 

ID: &#8216;a&#8217;..&#8217;z&#8217;

 

When that is not a valid range in your target environment? 

 

Change the ranges to:

 

ID: &#8216;a&#8217;..&#8217;k&#8217; | &#8216;l&#8217;..&#8217;t&#8217; &#8230;

 

Or whatever the valid ranges are. ANLTR might be &#8216;clever&#8217; here and assuming ASCII, may merge those ranges, so you might need to fold the ranges into fragments and so on. However, if you rework your lexer rules, I am sure that this can be done in portable fashion that does not require ASCII assumptions within the compiler.

Thanks for the response, ...

Unfortunately, it won't work in our situation without major changes.  We already have legacy C code which is compiled with default/native, and while we can use a different compile option for the ANTLR generated code, I'm not sure if it's good moving forward with mixed compilation rules.

The argument remains that it means the generated C lexer code has to be compiled by an ASCII-based compiler which may not be that portable.

Best,

The z/OS C compiler is able to compile in a mode where string and character
literals are treated as ISO-8859-1.
