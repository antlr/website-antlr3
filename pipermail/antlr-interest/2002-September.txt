Hi,

Good to see you at work on antlr again :) (now hope that I get some time in
the near future to do some of the last debugging sessions on the C++ part :( )

Some small questions:

Does this do anything for parsers as well ? (too lazy to read the code ;) )
I saw no patches in the documentation I trust these are still pending ;) ;) ;)

Cheers,

Hi All,

I have meet last and hardest ambig warn, that I cannot resolve after 5-6
hours of working. The following are rules of interest:

ANTLR give warn:
    "ambiguity on k=1 "union" between branch 1 and exit branch."

1) Yes, I see *why* thi warn comes.

2) if comment line {LINE:  LL44}  then no warn, and I get CORRECTLY working
grammar. I have check on tests.

3) PROBLEM is that I cannot find NOT syntax predicate, not semantic
predicate that can resolve this warning.

For example I have try the next

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------

         ( ((join_type)? "join") =>
                (join_type)? "join"^ table_reference ( join_specification )?

Subject: [antlr-interest] C# generator, tree & bug report
Message-ID: <000701c25295$417fbb50$dabb0ad2@hermes>

Hi folks !

I was using ANTLR to write a little code generator.
C# is the natural language of my programs.
So I though a C# Parser would be more powerfullto do some of my app specific
stuff.
I also use customized AST tree construction in my parser.
something like :
args
 :(
     ! LPAR RPAR { #args = #[VOID]; }
     |! (LPAR VOID RPAR)=> LPAR VOID RPAR { #args = #[VOID]; }
     | LPAR! argList RPAR!
    )
 { #args = #([PARAMS, "args"], #args); }
    ;
but I have some trouble with this contruction semantic:
"#args = #[VOID];"

as it generate:
args_AST = (AST)astFactory.create(VOID);
whereas it should generate (in C#, as it is correct in Java)
args_AST = (AST)astFactory.create(MyTokenTypes.VOID);

mmhh..
that's very curious.
I use this syntax more than once, but it write this uncorrect output only
once.
my grammar file is relatively short, I could send it to whoever is
interested, if needed....

cheers,
Lloyd

Thanks...  I must say that the code is really disgusting viewing it 
again after quite an absence and with the perspective of having written 
a commercial program (jGuru server).  Ick Ick Ick!  Oh well, I was a 
prototype guy.  With luck, future work will benefit from my newfound 
respect for real coding! ;)

Sure is...i'll update the doc.  It doesn't affect parsers, only a 
lexer's nextToken--not even lexer rules that call other lexer rules.  
This is a prelude to the future ;)

I will correct the missing reference to the plugin; I'll ref from the 
ANTLR site.  Ok, on main page.

I'm hoping to totally redo the website sometime this Fall.

Not sure about the doc link problem, btw.

Hi,

I have the following rule in my grammer:

factor: (col EQ) => (col EQ^ value)
         | (col NE) => (col NE^ value)
         | (col ("not")? "like") => ( col ("not")? "like" value) ;

For the last line I want to create a tree:

    not
    |--like
       |--col
       |--value

But I cannot work out how.

Thanks
Mark

I presume you mean that C# is the implementation language right?. 

As opposed to the source language for your lexer/parser or indeed the 
target language you will be generating from your project.

I can't remember if it always adds the prefix for you. It can in some 
situation but in general you should do that yourself.

[Actually, from the next upgrade that - adding the prefix - wouldn't 
be _neccesary_ anymore.]

Please post it to the list and I will have a look. Please include as 
much detail as you have.

Incidentally, I can only help with the C# codegen from www.antlr.org 
OK?. Pls include the timestamp of the .zip file or when roughly you 
downloaded the C# code generator you are using?. 

Cheers!,

Hi, 

thanks for this. It is the first reply I got :-)

I was thinking mainly whether the difference in performance in the
generated parser has any similarity to the difference in performance of
the lexer side (as far as I know from reading the FAQ at jguru there is
an issue of performance of the lexer when compared to flex generated
lexers).

Also I am interested in the issue of grammar inheritance: is that
feasible in pccts at all? Has anyone tried this with ANTLR?

Best regards,

Elias

here is the grammar file.
at line 69 there is the faulty code (fixed with
{ #args = #[GLExtTokenTypes.VOID]; }
)
the other #something = #[MyImaginaryToken]
work great without prefixing by "GLExtTokenTypes."
so it's a kind of bug report.

I downloaded the C# code generator the 29th of september (5 days ago, now)
I was not able to find any timestamp object in it.

Anyway it's great work. I have now an other grammar which has no trouble and
work great.
I just want to testimony that I am a happy ANTLR user. and ANTLR is great
and would surely take over the world !... (as stated on the accurate Terence
page)

Message-ID: <000a01c25402$975c6dc0$b6a70ad2@hermes>

I have a tree parser. and I have tree I want to read muliple time, simplyfing each time.

let's imagine I have

file: (node1 | node2) *;
node1: #(NODE1 FOO);
node2: #(NODE2 BAR);

I want to do something with node1 on first pas and remove it.

I tryed something like:

options {
    buildAST = true;
}
stage1: (!node1Analysis | .) *;

stage2:! (node2Analysis) *;

where stage2 is called with getAST() produce by stage1.
unfrtunately, hen I do that the node2 is empty, where all child are gone ?
I can't understand.
has anyone idea ?

sorry for all syntax error !
I corrected !

I have a tree parser. and I have tree I want to read multiple time,
simplifying it each time.

let's imagine I have

file: (node1 | node2) *;
node1: #(NODE1 FOO);
node2: #(NODE2 BAR);

I want to do something with node1 on first pass and remove it.
to only have node2 on the second pass

I tryed something like:

options {
    buildAST = true;
}
stage1: (!node1Analysis | .) *;

stage2:! (node2Analysis) *;

where stage2 is called with getAST() produced by stage1.
unfortunately, when I do that the node2 is empty, where are all childs gone
?
I can't understand.
has anyone an idea, please ?

to help you I send a zipped project.....

When you use . ANTLR copies the current node in the return AST _without_
children. Try:

stage1: (!node1Analysis | node2) *;

node2: #(NODE2 BAR);

ANTLR will now have to parse all node2 subtree, and the children will be
copied to returned AST.


Hope it works,
Bogdan

yacc would resolve this with precedence rules. So
what is needed is the determination of the meaning

 a join b join c.
is it left associative? right assoc? or non.

I suspect it is non, so 

joined_table
     :    table_reference ("join"^ joined_table)?
     ;
 
 table_reference
     :    table_name             // IDENT
     |    subquery               // '(' query ')'
     ;
 

is probably the right approach. So

a join b join c

would become

a--join

   b--c

Okay, I see idea. But what you suggest if JOIN should be left associative?
In fact it must be left associative...

Elias-

I have observed a 7X performance improvement in ANTLR 
generated compiler front ends through the use of aggressive
compiler optimization.  And my input sets are quite large
(>130 MB) so I have confidence that this is real.  I've 
achieved these results using the JOVE native compiler for
JAVA and the "-Ox" compiler flag in MSVC++ 6.0 for C++ with
two different compilers showing very similar results.

Subject: [antlr-interest] C# generator. caseSensitive problems
Message-ID: <al7oiq+892f@eGroups.com>

Hi !

There are some bugs in C# generator

1) When set the lexer options, generated C#-code is not compiled.
..... ANTLR
    options { 
        caseSensitive = false;
        caseSensitiveLiterals = false;
    }

..... C# lexer code
public Ora9TypeLexer(LexerSharedInputState state) : base(state)
	{
		caseSensitiveLiterals = false;
		setCaseSensitive(false);
		literals = new Hashtable
(System.Collections.CaseInsensitiveHashCodeProvider, null);

There is error in last line.

Code without compiling errors look like this:
(new System.Collections.CaseInsensitiveHashCodeProvider(), null);

2) ANTLR ORACLESQL7 parser does not work correctly with C# generator, 
while with Java generator works great.

SQL Statement : select a from b; ( C# - OK; Java - OK )
SQL Statement : sElecT a from b; ( C# - ERROR; Java - OK )

I think this problem take place because there are some
implementation bugs.

Could you help me to find the author of C# generator.
I'm going to correct this bugs and include them in next patch.
Or maybe somebody fix them yet?

Aleksey.

Message-ID: <B1F6F2DA362BD2118EA30008C75618E3063AE377@eugexc01ntms.eugalg.hboc.com>

I just wanted to complement the ANTLR development team on a quality
tool. I was able to create a parser and a program that uses the
resulting AST for the subset of Oracle DDL SQL that our product uses in
about 6 hours. This included picking the tool up for the first time,
dusting off some college days BNF knowledge, creating the grammar
definition, and creating the program that crawls the AST.

Well Done. 

Background, if you are interested: 

I had to create a tool that documents a Oracle schema. As input, I had
the Oracle schema text file, which I had to parse, meta model
information from our Object Relational Tool, and documentation about our
objects. The tool had to parse the schema, and relate the table and
column information to the object information and kick out the
documentation. Kind of a fun problem in the end. I used the following
tools:

Ant - I used this as the execution shell. 
ANTLR - I used this to create the SQL parser 
Velocity - I used this so that a designer could create the final HTML
document

Hi Gary, good to hea from you again :)

Meaning ANTLR interpreted vs compiled is 7x or compiled ANTLR vs C++ is 
7x?

We should make a quicky little write up on this and make a faq or small 
article on the site.

I hope to have time to redo the site this Fall.

Hi Terence-

I haven't done any performance profiling on interpreted code.
What I've seen most recently is that an ANTLR generated C++
compiler I'm writing spends most of it's time in ANTLR code, 
and that aggressive compiler optimization (MSVC6.0 "\Ox") of
both the ANTLR C++ libraries and my code improves execution
time by a factor of seven, versus no compiler optimization.

The optimzed C++ compiler exection times are about the same as
what I see from a very similar ANTLR generated JAVA compiler,
compiled into a native Windows executable using JOVE 
(www.instantiations.com).  

>>From my perspective, these times are very satisfactory as I'm able
to process a 130MB input set in ~3.5 minutes.

I think it would be very interesting to see what the performance
improvement would be if I added a FLEX generated lexer.  If I
can get money for a summer hire or coop student next year, maybe
I will make it their project.  Right now, things are kinda tight,
and no one's complaining about compile times.

Thanks!

Gary

warnWhenFollowAmbig turns on/off warnings when the lookahead following 
a loop or rule I think is nondeterministic with an alternative of the 
current decision.  The other is a general "shut up" message :)

Natively compile like Gary was just talking about? ;)

I'd look at the output code to see if you can see anything.

Also note that 1.4 java is supposed to be much faster at IO than 1.3 
and before.  Let's hope ;)

Mark -

Have you profiled your application to see where it's spending
the most time?

Also, sometime ago someone pointed out in this 
group that using BufferedInputStream dramatically improves 
performance.

Subject: [antlr-interest] XML Unicode char filtering
Message-ID: <albgm6+r939@eGroups.com>

For a Unicode lexer, what is the best way to filter-out a complex set 
of character ranges?

I suppose my choices are:
1. Define a huge set of ranges in the CharVocabulary option.
2. Use a complex filter rule.

I'm filtering all invalid Unicode characters, which are defined by: 
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#CharClasses

Currently, I'm using the second choice, a filter rule. For the first 
choice, it would be great if the CharVocabulary option could take a 
lexer rule.

Thanks,

Subject: [antlr-interest] Partial tree transformation
Message-ID: <alff2j+43di@eGroups.com>

Greetings

Suppose we have an AST generated by ANTLR. Is there a way to perform a
transformation for only certain tree patterns without defining rules
that lead to that pattern?

For example, let's say that having a Java AST generated by the java.g
grammar (the one from the ANTLR example grammars) one wants to filter
out the final modifier. Based on java.tree.g, only the "modifier" rule
should be defined. The nodes that do not match the "modifier" pattern
should be copied by default to the resulting AST. However, if I do
this way, the "modifier" rule is never matched but I get an unexpected
node error.

Is there a way to do this?

Robert

That is a different philosophy than the tree grammar approach.  
However, in old Sorcerer I had support routines that worked like fscanf 
called tscant or something that let you ask for all references to trees 
of a certain form.  There is something similar in ANTLR, but can't 
remember the name right off the top of my head.

Ah.   Yes, try this class

antlr.ASTIterator

it has a next() method that keeps looking for subtrees I think.  You 
are really just asking for a depth first search.  Easy to add if we 
don't have precisely what you need. :)

I need to execute while loop, the parser rule is:

my tree walker rules:

while_ [bool OK]
{
VARIANT * pVal;
}
 : 
 #(WHILE LPAREN pVal=ex:expression RPAREN DO (ddo:statement[OK])* 
      	{
      		while (pVal->boolVal)

      		  pVal=orphan_expression(ex);		  
     		}
      	}  
   END) 	
 ;

orphan_expression returns [VARIANT * pVal] : pVal=expression;

orphan_statement [bool OK] : (statement [OK])*;

The "while_" rule is executed only one time :( What can I do with my 
tree parser to solve this problem?? beforehand thank's

To be clear, Java v1.4 supports a number of I/O improvements in the "nio"
(New I/O) package (such as memory-mapped files).

Those changes have *NOT* yet been incorporated into the old, standard Java
I/O packages.  That might happen for Java v1.5.

So, any code that y'all want to make faster by taking advantage of the new
I/O support has to be rewritten.

Take care,
	John

Ouch.  Dang!  I'll look at the API, but this is something we could use 
by making a new constructor on the lexer to take a different kind o 
stream, right?

I just don't quite see how this would work.  Briefly, I have defined a
grammar that matches certain bytes in a binary stream; each matched
byte is followed by a variable number of bytes associated with that
token (AKA a "segment").  The grammar defines the order in which these
segments can occur.  As far as the parser is concerned, the segments
are black boxes.

Unfortunately, there is no end marker to indicate the end of a
segment.  The two bytes following the matched token byte do contain
the number of bytes in that segment, though, which could help.

My original way of thinking is that when I match a token, I switch
control to my own code for reading the segment bytes from the
(std::)stream.  When finished reading the segment, I would reset the
parser (perhaps implicitly by modifying the stream) to resume parsing
at the end of the segment, which should be pointing to the next token.
This is my naive approach, but....

You stated that I could create a second lexer for reading a segment, a
scenario where ANTLR would still control reading the input.  Since
there are no tokens defined for this second lexer, would it just match
"."  (all characters), calling my code to populate a string or other
structure with each incoming byte?  That sounds wasteful....  Bear in
mind I don't know how long each segment is until I start reading it,
so I can't create a static rule to outright match N bytes.

As soon as I've read the proper number of bytes, I could switch back
to the main lexer.

I understand, but it's unfortunate; it's exactly what I'd like to do.

Depends.  The memory mapped file channel stuff would definitely be nice to
support.  You should also check out the new Character Sequence stuff to see
if that would be useful.

However, supporting non-blocking I/O doesn't seem to make sense for
something like ANTLR.

Take care,

Subject: [antlr-interest] help translating C to Java
Message-ID: <aljcee+46e4@eGroups.com>

Hi,

I am a newbie here and I would like to ask for your advice:

I want to build a C to Java translator, one that would generate Java 
source as close as possible with what a Java programmer would write 
(when implementing the same program). The Java source does not have 
to be compilable and the C programs would be limited to those that 
use no libraries (except the standard ones).

I do intend this as a learning experience, but my main goal is to get 
some C code translated, so I naively hope that I don't have to become 
an expert in parser generators as a prerequisite.

Do you think this is feasible ? Is Antlr a good starting point ? What 
would be the steps involved ?

Thank you in advance,

Florin

Folks,

FYI, I'll be teaching a graduate language course at the University of 
San Francisco next semester (Spring 2003) in case anybody in the area 
wants to enroll or audit the class.  It'll be all about the nature of 
computer languages, their recognition and translation (naturally using 
ANTLR).  Lots on domain-specific languages etc...  A non-trivial 
project or series of smaller projects will be required.  This is not a 
survey of languages course.

If anybody is contemplating attending, please let me know directly to 
parrt at jguru dot com (and whether you'd prefer a late afternoon or 
evening class; twice a week).

Thanks,

I believe I begin to understand.  Accounting for
comments in the Java grammar, for example, would
necessitate liberally sprinkling the tokens throughout
the parser rules, to represent the fact that they can
occur anywhere.  The end of having the tokens in the
tree might not be worth the effort and resulting
unreadable parser rules, correct?  The other option
you mentioned, adding comments as attributes of nodes,
I do not understand.  Would this approach be
applicable to my situation and if so how is it most
easily accomplished?

TIA,
Matt

Subject: [antlr-interest] Quaestion about adding logic checks into the parsers grammer..
Message-ID: <006301c258ab$c6928c20$3200a8c0@athlonxp>

Hi,

after using flex/bison for months (if not years), i thought it's time to get
used to a more modern lexer/parser :-)
actually i am playing around with antlr to see what is possible and what
not..

actually i try to figure out how i can add my own checks to the grammer, a
pretty silly example (to help you understand what i want to try):

the lexer returns me a ID which is defined like ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z')

now in the parser i want to have something simular to:

name
    :    name_a // got a ID beginning with a
    |    name_b // got a ID beginning with b
    ;

name_b
    :    /*only match if ID begins with b*/ ID
    ;

name_a
    :    /*only match if ID begins with a*/ ID
    ;

for sure in this case it could be done in the lexer, and it's just a dang
silly example...

i tryed to do:
name_a
    :    {LA(1)==ID && LT(1).get()->getText()=="a"}? ID
    ;

or:

name_a
    :    ({LA(1)==ID && LT(1).get()->getText()=="a"}?)=> ID
    |    IGNORE_ME_TOKEN
    ;

and:

name_a
    :    i:ID {i->getText()=="a"}?
    ;

but it seems that they all only help for semantical checks, how can i do
such checks for the Syntax ?
i want to use this with a Symbol Table, if a ID has been already used i want
to use different rules etc...

thanks for your help,
Kevin

Oops, thought of another way, which might be more what you are looking for,
since you mentioned syntactic predicates. Leave the semantic checks within
name_a and name_b, and then add syntactic predicates within name:

name
    :    (name_a)=> name_a
    |    (name_b)=> name_b
    ;

Hi Kevin,

I'll try answering, but hopefully the experts will check my work. :-)

I think you are trying to do things in an LR kind of way that won't work
with Antlr's LL. You will want to move your semantic predicate up to name:

name
    :    {LT(1).get()->getText()=="a"}? name_a
    |    name_b
    ;


Since Terrence is going back to teaching, maybe he can ease back into it by
grading my answer. ;-)

John

ah thanks,

this seem to work, man why i didn't think about this :-) thanks!!
but still, it would be even better if i just could use it like name_a
without doing a predicate bevor it..
is this possible ? is there another solution or way to hide it ?

if not, i can live with this solution though :-)

Antlr has a great feature called a "hidden token filter". You let the
whitespace go through as tokens from your lexer, and then the filter
decides what tokens go through to the parser for it to turn into nodes. At
the same time, those "hidden tokens" which were filtered out are added as
extra links hanging off the regular AST nodes. That way you can walk the
AST for regular semantic work, and you can also examine AST nodes for
attached hidden tokens. I use this heavily for my work.

In http://www.antlr.org/articles.html , look for "Preserving Whitespace
During Translation".

John

You might search the Antlr archives for requests for "hoisting". It's
probably what you have in mind, and no, Antlr doesn't do it (yet).
Actually, I think Terence recently added some hoisting support to the
lexer, so we can keep our fingers crossed for future versions for the
parser.

While you are considering constructors how about adding a constructor which
accepts either a string or a byte array?  This would save me from having to
convert a string into a ByteArrayInputStream.

Ouch.  Dang!  I'll look at the API, but this is something we could use
by making a new constructor on the lexer to take a different kind o
stream, right?

I have an interesting parsing problem. I want dig certain context free
constructs out of a file, while ignoring all the other constructs in the
file. My specific case is that I have a file with a bunch of SQL in it,
but all I really care about are the create table statements. The create
table statements I'm concerned with can be parsed with the following
rules:

createTable 
    :   "create" (ID)* "table" ID LPAREN columns RPAREN 
    ; 
    
columns 
    :   column (COMMA column)* 
    ; 
    
column 
    :   name datatype (ID)* 
    ; 
    
datatype 
    :   (   "varchar" (size)* 
        |   "varchar2" (size)* 
        |   "number" (size)* 
        |   "date" 
        |   "integer" 
        |   "long" ("raw")* 
        ) 
    ; 
    
size 
    :   LPAREN CARDINAL RPAREN 
    ; 

To solve this problem, I'm thinking of using token stream filters, but I
can't look ahead in a token stream filter so that I could recognize when
I'm in a create table statement.

My basic design would be to use a filter that turns on output of tokens
when in a create table statement, and the parser grammar would have a
semantic rule that would turn off token output when the create table
statement has been fully recognized.

Does anybody have any experience with such a thing?

Check out a similar problem/solution at
http://www.codetransform.com/filterexample.html

I use a parser to find particular constructs and pass the rest on.

Or, you might be able to do it all in the lexer with a filter rule.  See the
article about using antlr like sed on antlr.org.

Richard--

A brute force method would be to change your top-level definition to

input:
     (    "create" ((table)=> table)?
          | ~"create"
     )* EOF
     ;

with table being your createTable rule minus the "create" and all 
actions confined to table and the rules that it invokes.

Adding a token stream filter would then improve performance--the 
action in the ~"create" alternative would be to toggle nextToken to 
skip tokens until "create" is encountered--but not functionality.

Subject: [antlr-interest] syntax predicates
Message-ID: <alr6qk+vd4n@eGroups.com>

I have a question about syntax predicates because I think I found a 
bug.

I have the following grammar snippet

startRule
:   (   "create" (("or" "replace" "force" "view") => createView)?
    |   skipTokens
    )* EOF
;
    
createView
    :   (ID)* "view"
    ;
    
skipTokens
    :   ~("create")
    ;

And it generates the following code in the startRule method

case LITERAL_create :
    {
        AST tmp1_AST = null;
        tmp1_AST = (AST) astFactory.create(LT(1));
        astFactory.addASTChild(
            currentAST,
            tmp1_AST);
        match(LITERAL_create);
        {
            boolean synPredMatched2949 = false;
            if (((LA(1) == LITERAL_view
                || LA(1) == ID)
                && (_tokenSet_0.member(LA(2)))
                && (_tokenSet_0.member(LA(3)))
                && (_tokenSet_0.member(LA(4))))) {
                int _m2949 = mark();
                synPredMatched2949 = true;
                inputState.guessing++;
                try {
                    {
                        match(LITERAL_or);
                        match(LITERAL_replace);
                        match(LITERAL_force);
                        match(LITERAL_view);
                    }
                }
                catch (RecognitionException pe) {
                    synPredMatched2949 = false;
                }
                rewind(_m2949);
                inputState.guessing--;
            }

The problem seems to be the following line of code:

if (((LA(1) == LITERAL_view
    || LA(1) == ID)

Which is generated because of the syntax predicate, however the 
syntax predicate is for the literal "or", not an ID or the 
literal "view". I'm not sure what gives, but this causes problems 
when the testLiterals options is true for an ID token because the 
token is kicked out of the lexicial analyzer as a LITERAL_or instead 
of an ID.

Has anybody else encountered this problem?

I've worked around it by just using my createView rule as a predicate 
to createView, but I thought I would ask.

Subject: [antlr-interest] A question about token bit sets

I see the following code generated in my Parser classes:

    private static final long[] mk_tokenSet_0() {
        long[] data = { 32754L, 0L, 0L, 0L };
        return data;
    }
    public static final BitSet _tokenSet_0 =
        new BitSet(mk_tokenSet_0());


What is the best way to tell what tokens are memebers of _tokenSet_0?

Yeah, there's a synpred bug in 2.7--synpreds only work if they 
reference a single rule or token.  I pointed this out to Ter a few 
months back, so it's probably on the "to be fixed" list.

Thanks for the response, now I know I'm not going nuts. I'm using the
suggestion that you gave in an earlier e-mail for how to pick the blocks
I wanted out of a crowd, but I needed to detect syntax errors once I was
in my block. I started by using literals, however I found that did not
work because of the bug below. So, I went to an abbreviated rule that I
called identifyView that has the minimum tokens in it required to
identify the block I want to parse. This seems to be working good
because it meets my two requirements. 1. Skip the stuff I don't care
about 2. Detect syntax errors in the blocks I do care about.

My basic grammar ended up being: 

startRule 
        :       (       "create"! ((identifyView)=> createView)? 
                |       skipTokens! 
                )* EOF 
        ; 
        
identifyView 
        :       (ID)* "view" 
        ; 
        
createView 
        :       (ID!)* "view"^ ID^ "as" "select" columns "from" objects 
        ; 
        
skipTokens 
        :       ~("create") 
        ; 

Seems to work good. 

Thanks for all your help. 

Richard

antlr -diagnostic <yourgrammarfile>

Should give you those I think (in a text file)

Or alternatively you can turn on C++ codegen, ok it makes no sense but the
C++ codegenerator dumps out comments with the contents of the tokensets in
these definitions.

Cheers,

Ric

PS I think that predicate bug you stumbled on is fixed in the 2.7.2a series
and also in the bugfix devel version on
http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr/

Rick, 

Thanks for the tip about token sets. 

I'm using 2.7.2a2, and I found the syntax predicate bug, so I don't
think the fix is there.

Syn preds only work on more than one alt (>1 alt implies a decision); 
not sure what you referring to with the single rule/token thing.  But 
in this case, this makes sense, but with only one alt the code 
generator probably screws up since the 2nd alt (the empt alt) is 
implied.  try (...| ) instead of (...)?

Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLR based Python parser
Message-ID: <am01gi+9koq@eGroups.com>

Hi,
   I am in the process of writing a parser
for Python using antlr for a project. I have
handled most of the Python grammar but am having
problems specifying parts of it in the antlr
format.
   This grammar is successfully accepted by other
Python based parsers. The part that I am talking
about is as follows:

/* Start of Grammar */

primary : 
             atom | attributeref
              | subscription | slicing | call;

attributeref : 
             primary "." IDENTIFIER;

subscription : 
             primary "[" expression_list "]";

slicing : 
             simple_slicing | extended_slicing;
  
simple_slicing : 
             primary "[" short_slice "]";
  
extended_slicing : 
             primary "[" slice_list "]" ;
             
call : 
             primary "(" (argument_list)? ")";  

/* End of Grammar */

Any help than anyone can provide would
be appreciated very much.

Thanks,
Shyam

Shayam asked about transforming the following grammar fragment from
the definition of Python for use in Antlr:

/* Start of Grammar */

primary : 
             atom | attributeref
              | subscription | slicing | call;

attributeref : 
             primary "." IDENTIFIER;

subscription : 
             primary "[" expression_list "]";

slicing : 
             simple_slicing | extended_slicing;
  
simple_slicing : 
             primary "[" short_slice "]";
  
extended_slicing : 
             primary "[" slice_list "]" ;
             
call : 
             primary "(" (argument_list)? ")";  

/* End of Grammar */

I do not know Python at all, but I'd try:

    1) factor the primary out of the atributeref, subscription,
       simple_slicing, extended_slicing and call rules;

    2) factor the "[" out of the resultant new forms of the
       subscription, simple_slicing, and extended_slicing rules;

    3) and then remove the recursion in primary

these transformations yield (i think):

primary :
    atom ( a | s | c )*
  ;

a :
    "." IDENTIFIER
  ;

s :
    "[" ( expression_list | short_slice | slice_list ) "]"
  ;

c :
    "(" ( argument_list )? ")"
  ;

Hope this helps....

Just fixed in latest 2.7.2a3; no longer generates the unnecessary loop.

Added the Ctor back in that didn't ask for column.

The code below is correct.  ANTLR is being smart and putting in a quick 
sanity check before doing the backtrack.  ANTLR checks that the 
lookahead is reasonably (i.e., consistent with matching rule 
createView) before wasting time doing a predicate.  Note that the 
lookahead for createView is {ID,"view"} at k=1.  The "view" test does 
not come from the last token in the predicate.  BTW, the predicate you 
have makes no sense really.

Actually it's generated because that predicates createView.  Somewhere 
in a paper or something I show that ANTLR prevents unnecessary 
backtracking by doing a quick sanity check.

Hope this clears this up.

I've added getFilename/setFilename methods (empty impl) to Token.java, 
but I'm not sure about adding the ctor to NoViableAltException and the 
code generator.  Seems that now you'll get the filename but unless I 
add real functionality to Token it will have a bogus default filename.  
Hmm...plus, what about other exceptions?  Seems I'd have to make wide 
changes.  I'll add the basic interface for now and see what happens I 
guess.

Ok, in 2.7.2a3.

Thanks,
Ter

Yep, you can easily get into an infinite loop.  ANTLR is guaranteed to 
terminate if I have a consume at each error.  I suppose I could have 
another means that tracked whether I'd been at a space w/o consuming 
but that is harder.  Are you getting bad error sync?

BTW, I saw the infinite loop problem when building the C++ parser with 
the folks at NeXT, hence, I added the "must terminate" functionality :)

Message-ID: <AAEHIGBBDDKLBPEEPACJOEIKCHAA.oliver-lists@puppycrawl.com>

Hi,

I am the author of a tool called Checkstyle (http://checkstyle.sf.net) which
checks that Java code confirms to a coding standard. By default the Sun coding
standard. The tool makes extensive use of ANTLR.

I am in the process of refactoring the way Checkstyle works, and want to track
line & column information in syntactic predicates. In my research I came across
the article on tracking column information at
http://www.antlr.org/fieldguide/columns/index.html.

At the end of the article it says that is it possible to track column info for
syntactic predicates. Does anybody have any more information (or better still
examples) on how to do this.

Regards,
Oliver

Richard--

Ter managed to convince me that this wasn't an example of the bug I 
encountered--the problem in your code is that "or", "replace", and 
"force" are literals, not IDs, so the synpred is what is incorrect.

For penance, I now have to resurrect the bug that I encountered so 
that Ter can fix it ...

Terence,

May I recommend that instead of getFilename/setFilename, you have getURL 
and setURL()? I am using ANTLR inside of NetBeans and I've added an 
extension just as you described. With NetBeans they have a filesystem 
abstraction that uses URL's of the form nbfs://XXXX to identify files, 
so I can't use a "filename" per se. Also, get/setFilename wouldn't be 
very useful for parsing from a HTTP stream.

Hi Oliver, sounds like a great tool :)

That article is pretty old.  ANTLR tracks column number now 
automatically.  I think it's even stored in the token objects now.

Hi,

Hmm...well, getInputName or some such would work.  i'm worried that URL 
would make people think you needed file:// on the front or something.  
Can you just use the method knowing it's a bit of a misnomer?

What are you doing with NetBeans?  A cool secret project?

Terence,

It isn't a big deal to me. I was actually thinking that people would use 
the "file://" form instead (actually, I use java.net.URL objects), but 
then they'd have to have URL->"friendly filename" mapper. I already have 
to have a URL->"friendly filename" mapper but my requirements are not as 
common, probably.

Actually, I would be more interested in adding a "tokenClass" option for 
the lexer. That way, things like this extension would be quite easy to 
individual users to do and wouldn't require the ugly downcasting that is 
currently required. I was thinking that it would work something as follows:

options { tokenClass=org.brianlsmith.smn.reader.ValuedToken; }

* When set at the lexer grammar level, it defines the type of the token 
class.

* When set at the parser grammar level, it defines the type of the token 
class that the parser assumes that the lexer returns.

* When set at the rule level, it defines the type of the token that will 
be returned by the rule (to support the heterogenous token feature as 
explained in the documentation).

* Rules that reference tokens in the lexer would no longer have to 
downcast from antlr.Token (e.g. no need to cast from antlr.Token to 
o.b.s.r.ValuedToken).

* Rules that reference tokens in the parser would no longer have to 
downcast from antlr.Token either.

* When creating tokens, the makeToken() method would automatically 
instantiate the correct class and set the type, column, line as 
necessary. Lexer creators could then override makeToken() and set custom 
properties (like filename, url, etc.) as necessary. Then these custom 
properties would automatically be available in the lexer grammar.

The problem I am having is that is does not seem to track column information
for all nodes. I have been trying with ANTLR 2.7.1 and 2.7.2a2.

I have attached a sample input file I have been testing with. Also attached
is a capture of the AST tree using the -showtree option. I am using the
standard Java grammar available from the web site.

As you can see some of the leaf nodes under "VARIABLE_DEF" do not have any
column or line number information. I want to now how to get this information
put into the AST.

Folks,

Extending Ric's work, I have made $FIRST and $FOLLOW computations 
available to actions and exception actions.  If you omit the arg it 
assumes current rule.  Note that this returns the name of a bitset you 
can use to test or pass to consumeUntil().

a : A {$FIRST(a); $FIRST} B
   exception
     catch [MyExc e] {
         foo = $FOLLOW(a);
         consumeUntil($FIRST(c));
     }
;

You can use for a variety of things:

if ( $FIRST(a).member(LBRACK) ) {...}

Ter
PS	Ric, note that I've moved the computation into the two action.g 
files (moving from code generators; cleaner).

I was gonna fix a few more things before doing another snapshot, but 
say the word and I'll mail you a jar.  It's about .5M source/classes.  
I'm running off to grab some chow but will check mail in a few...

Maybe in the long run we should remove the column/line/filename stuff and
replace it by a user definable class, with according set/get methods. This
would add most flexibility in possiblities to store stuff with the token.

Something like this:

public NoViableAltException( Token t, Parser p ) {
   super("NoViableAlt", p.getFilename(), p.getLine(), p.getColumn());
   token = t;
}

Then if we add options to specify the name of the used NoViableException or
a factory or something like it, then we have all the tools to customize
easily at will.

If I ever get time for a C++ backend TNG then I'll probably go that way,
for a first prototype.

Cheers,

Ric

Subject: [antlr-interest] How can I write lexer with multiple codepage support?
Message-ID: <am4be1+5c4e@eGroups.com>

How can I write lexer with multiple codepage support?

In my grammar identifiers space not only characters from 0x00-0x7f
range.

They also partially use 0x7f - 0xff range. 
But letters from this range depends from active CodePage. 

Grammar is'not case sensitive, and toUpper method must work 
correctly for active CodePage.

How is better to add "active CodePage support" 
to antlr-runtime and grammar file?

How is better to add lexer rules for identifiers, 
which vocabulary depends from isLetter() method?
Shall I use guard predicates like that or something else?
  ID : LETTER (LETTER|DIGIT)* ;

  LETTER : (.) => {isLetter( $getText );}? .;
  DIGIT : ('0'..'9');

Hi,

  I have a grammar rule like

exprlist: expr (COMMA expr)* (COMMA)?;

  This rule obviously gives me a nondeterminism
warning. Is there any way to remove this warning
by restructuring this rule.

Thanks,
Shyam

I suggest setting k>1 and then setting greedy=true for the (...)* loop 
to shut it up and make it always grab comma followed by start of expr.  
THis will work unless exprList can be followed by an Expr. No fuss no 
muss! :)

Hi Joe,

Still hoping for a solution to tracking column info for syntactic predicates.

Yes, the output from ANTLR certainly does not conform to the SUN coding
standards. The trick when running Checkstyle using the ANT task is to
exclude the generated ANTLR files.  The following is an example of how to
do this. Note that the generated ANTLR files are prefixed with "Generated".

    <checkstyle properties="docs/checkstyle.rules">
      <fileset dir="src/checkstyle"
               includes="**/*.java"
               excludes="**/Generated*.java"/>
    </checkstyle>

Regards,
Oliver

Subject: [antlr-interest] trace as an grammar and rule option
Message-ID: <am85kd+ptsa@eGroups.com>

Hello,

I have a situation where I can only reproduce a bug by testing my 
grammar on a file that is about 20k lines long. I used antlr and 
turned on -traceParser, and this looks like it will generate the 
output I need, however it is taking a very long time to run... 

I was wondering if anybody has ever thought about a trace option at 
the grammar and at the rule level?

I've been poking around in the antlr source, and I think it would be 
implemented very much like the defaultErrorHandler option. It seems 
that the touch points would be the following:

MakeGrammar.java is the only place the creates rule blocks. When it 
creates them, it copies the defaultErrorHandler option from the 
grammar. I think the same rules would apply for a trace option.

JavaCodeGenerator.java checks the grammar for the traceRules flag. 
This would be changed to test the rule block currently in context.

Grammar.java the setOption method would be modified to allow a trace 
option.

RuleBlock.java the setOption method would be modified to allow a 
trace option.

Are there any other touch points that I missed?

I think this would be useful because I would be able to reduce the 
number of rules that are trace that I really don't care about. At 
this time, my test for debugging takes enough time that I was able to 
research this change and start on the changes.

>>From my research, I think the changes would allow the option in 
lexers, parsers, and tree parsers.

If anybody thinks this is useful, I would be more that willing to 
submit the source files, or a diff patch back to the list. I'm using 
2.7.2a2, so I think this is fairly recent.

FYI there are separate options for lexer, parser and tree parser.  

They are:

-trace
-traceLexer
-traceParser
-traceTreeWalker

Rule level might be nice, but I've never needed it.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Taking control of the input stream
Message-ID: <am86gt+ccum@eGroups.com>

Howdy.  I just started using ANTLR and it looks like a great tool.  
I'm trying to write a grammer that parses IMAP commands (the spec 
doesn't seem consistant enough to allow generic parsing).  Here's the 
tricky part:

IMAP allows strings to be expressed as something it calls a 'literal' 
(not to be confused with what everyone else calls a literal).  
Servers must accept quoted strings and 
atoms (like the quoted-string message content here)

C: A003 APPEND saved-messages (\Seen) "Date: Mon, ..."

But servers must also be able to accept in the 'literal' form like 
this:

C: A003 APPEND saved-messages (\Seen) {310}
S: + continue
C: Date: Mon, 7 Feb 1994 21:52:25 -0800 (PST)
C: ...
C: (310 bytes later...)
S: A003 OK APPEND completed

I want my ANTLR grammer to see the {NUM} and eat up the next NUM 
bytes into a single token.  A general outline of the rule would look 
something like this:

literal	:	"{" len:NUMBER "}" CRLF
	{
	int length = Integer.parseInt(len.getText());
        out.println("+ continue");
	String value = [read the next 'length' bytes]
	}
	;

How can I do this (or is it not possible)?

Thanks,

David Weitzman

I'm not sure I completely understand the rule level trace. I kindoff got a
hunch that you want to do something similar to parts of the parseView
hooks (look at the code generated with -debug)

Dunno, my first reaction is something like why not put a few println's in
the rule to see what happens? Done in a few minutes, nothing fancy always
works :) Of course it can very much be that I misunderstood what you want
to do exactly....

Cheers,

Where you want to do this lexer or parser? It's been ages past since I've
been hacking on something IMAP-ish so not sure what would be the most
practical.

I've been thinking about rule-level trace too.  Nearly always you will want
to know the whole context from which the rule has been called.  Rarely is
the problem in a rule per se, it's more likely to be how the rules relate to
one another, so I'm not sure how useful it would be to have a rule-level

Subject: [antlr-interest] Generating Fake Lexical Tokens
Message-ID: <ama584+oc5n@eGroups.com>

Hi,

  I am writing a parser for Python and due to
the nature of Python's way of specifying statement
blocks I have to generate fake tokens.
  In Python statements are grouped together by their
indentation level. So, to let the parser detect a
change in the grouping the lexer needs to generate
fake tokens for INDENT and DEDENT.
   Consider the Python program
   if test:
       print "something"
       do_something()
   # Outside if
   do_somethingmore()
Now for the above program - The lexer needs to generate
an INDENT token before the print to let the parser
know that the following statements are part of an
if block. And similarly it needs to generate a DEDENT
token after do_something() to indicate end of the if
block. 
  I have the logic to generate the INDENT and DEDENT
tokens but I have no idea how to make the lexer report
them before or after the real tokens. Can anyone help
me out with this. I am looking for a way to insert
additional tokens in the token stream.

Thanks,
Shyam

Message-ID: <B1F6F2DA362BD2118EA30008C75618E3063AE43A@eugexc01ntms.eugalg.hboc.com>

I ended up implementing the grammar level trace and the rule level
trace. The reason that rule level trace is useful is because it is one
of the only ways to get println's when rules are guessing. The trace
also gives a very good standard picture of where the parser is and what
tokens are being examined in the context. I've been using trace on
various rules to get a clear understanding of how rules are interacting,
etc.

This was not very hard to implement. By the way, the grammar level trace
option is very useful because it allows turning on trace without having
to modify an ant build.xml. It would also be useful for things like the
eclipse antlr integration that does not allow the setting of options.

If there is interest in the community, I can send a diff patch to the
list.

I suppose it would have to be the lexer, wouldn't it?  If I could 
somehow specify in a lexer token specification that I want to read 
in the next NUM characters, whatever they might be, that should 
be enough.

There might be a better way of approaching the whole problem, 
but I think I like the idea of seperating the commands from their 
syntax with a parser.  It isn't the simplest solution, but I can't
think of an alternative that's flexible and minimizes code 
repitition.

I've found a solution.  Just thought I'd share.  It's a token 
definition.  This is what it looks like:

LITERAL	:	"{" num:NUMBER "}" CRLF
	{
	  int length = Integer.parseInt(num.getText());
	  InputBuffer buf = getInputBuffer();
	  buf.mark();
	  buf.fill(length);
	  for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
	    buf.consume();
	  }
	  String value = buf.getLAChars().substring(0, length);
	  buf.commit();
	  System.out.println("Matched literal [" + value + "]");
	  setText(value);
	}
	;

Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLR build and package layout
Message-ID: <3D892CAF.5080500@uiowa.edu>

Hi everybody,

(1) I am interested in contributing some patches to ANTLR. But, the 
makefile seems not to work on Windows, with or without Cygwin. Since 
ANTLR is pure Java, I am wondering if the ANTLR developers would 
consider switching to Apache Jakarta ANT for building? I could submit 
the ANT build script.

(2) It would be easier to understand the ANTLR source code if it were 
divided into more packages. It is particularly confusing to have the 
ANTLR runtime library and the code generator source code together in the 
same package. Would it be possible to move the classes that support 
antlr.Tool to their own package (antlr.tool.*)? Presumably antlr.Tool 
itself would have to stay in the "antlr" package for backwards 
compatibility with the ANTLR ANT Task and IDE integration, but I am not 
sure.

I think it would also be nice to seperate the packages inside the 
runtime library for the lexer, parser, and AST support (antlr.lexer, 
antlr.parser, and antlr.ast?) Obviously, moving any of the runtimes 
classes would break runtime compatibility, but perhaps it could be done 
for 3.0 and beyond?

Thanks,
Brian

FYI - Monty provided the solution to my problem. I needed to add the
following code to my Custom AST class:

    public void initialize(AST t) 
    {
        setText(t.getText());
        setType(t.getType());
        mLineNo = ((DetailAST) t).getLineNo();
        mColumnNo = ((DetailAST) t).getColumnNo();
    }

Then the line numbers will show up. He also explained that syntactic
predicates can't know about line numbers or columns, but semantic
predicates can.

Thanks Monty!

Oliver

I guess that will work. You btw can ommit the mark and commit. Another
option is maybe using a closure rule with a predicate to break out of it (I
think you need a prerelease antlr to do this)

What is not working on windows? I personally am not ANT fan, then again I'm

Good point. I think it's on the TODO list somewhere. Terence already did a
mea culpa about the source organisation a while back ;) No clue when this
will be taken on though.

I am fundamentally opposed to Ant (even though it is reputed to be 
good) because it forces users to type XML.  See "Humans Should Not Have 
to Grok XML", which explains why that's bad:

http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-sbxml.html

I believe I'm pretty persuasive in that article. ;)  [though it will 
make no difference whatsoever to most people who are "every language 
should be XML" people--makes me wanna retch, but that emotion is a good 
thing since it forced me to make ANTLR (yacc makes 
me...well..er...yack!)].

Nonetheless, my goal is to make ANTLR useful for you folks.  Hence, if 
somebody sends me a fresh Ant script with an explanation so I don't 
have to think much, I will consider inserting it and using it for ANTLR 
builds.

Okay, it seems like the Dev snapshots do not include everything to 
build. But, I tried with the antlr-2.7.2a2 distribution. When running 
./configure, I get:

configure: WARNING: I have to compile Test.class from scratch
checking if java.exe works... configure: error: The Java VM java.exe 
failed (see
  config.log, check the CLASSPATH?)

if I remove the java.exe test from the ./configure script, then 
./configure succeeds but then make fails:

=============================

=============================
make[1]: Entering directory `/cygdrive/e/software/antlr-2.7.2a2/antlr'

I checked and antlrall.jar exists and antlr/Tool.class is in it.

Totally disagree!

The link you gave doesn't talk about "why that's bad".


BTW, I wrote several compilers without using any
compiler compiler. However I never think that compiler
compiler is useless.

I don't have to tell you that you do make a strong
argument for why humans should not have to understand
XML, hence your antipathy toward Ant.  However, the
longer Ant remains a dominant force in the Java
community the more sophisticated the interfaces will
become for creating build files via GUIs rather than
by hand.  Perhaps this will appease you somewhat. 
Perhaps a compromise could be reached by providing a
link to an Ant build file, accompanied by a link to
your article, on the ANTLR site, but not in the main
distribution?  ;)

The article basically says that XML adds levels of
complexity the human mind has evolved to infer by
reflex.  Hopefully he wouldn't have to explain "why
that's bad."  Beyond that, I personally am careful how
I speak to those who have made fundamental
contributions to computer science.  Have you?

Just some thoughts,

Do you know Ant?

Sure, you may not think it a fundamental contribution
to computer science. However, it is much popular.


Regard the comment. The great man said:"because it
forces users to type XML". I don't think this is a
point since only one person needs to write a build.xml
for ANTLR and all others can share.

XML is not good if the data itself doesn't have tree
structure, such as, 2*3+e^(sin(x)). It may result the
data difficult to read. However, Ant is not the case.

What more do you want.  Why are you thrashing on this issue?

I know Ant just fine.  I use it daily; in fact I was
the one who seconded the opinion that an Ant file for
ANTLR would be a nice thing to have (in today's
discussion--more than likely the subject has come up
before).  Personally I tend to do everything the hard
way and will probably continue to type XML long after
the need has evaporated.  However if you read Ter's
bio you will learn that some of the concepts he has
put to use in ANTLR are viewed as groundbreaking work
in the field of parsing and language analysis.  The
man has far more education and experience (and quite
probably ability) than I, so even though I may
continue to want Ant build files despite his
convincing argument as to why Ant is a bad thing, I
will at the same time show him the respect he has
earned in our field.

Were I thrashing your issue?

No, I just said:"Totally disagree!" and "The link you
gave doesn't talk about 'why that's bad'". Then lots
of your fans jumped out. That's it. You have a good
kingdom. They think you are the person like Bool and
John von Neuman. However, I don't agree again. If you
are a real scholar, then you should tell them the
truth. The words I inputed is nothing wrong with the
truth.

Sorry to get into your kingdom.

First you did not notice that I am NOT Terence Parr!!!!  Therefore, I do not
have a kingdom or any loyal fans.  The term "trashing" means that you are
not letting the issue rest.  Give it up.  I am tired of being flooded with
your pointless emails.  

Terence has already said that he will include a Ant script with the
distribution.  So what is the point in this discussion.

BTW you should take your own advice " You should read everything you
inputed!"  First read the email very carefully before responding.  Maybe you
would have noticed that I was not Terence before responding.

Ter--

Why not make your kiddies write a domain specific language for 
generating skeletal ANT scripts?  That would be the obvious analog to 
the PCCTS Makefile generator and would be a good class assignment.

Yeah that could be cool.  I was thinking of having the students choose 
from languages to build so that we'd end up with lots of free grammars 
at the end (assuming they give the rights to me). :)

Heh, i just found an easy way get the current doc out of html and into 
my TML (text markup language).  I can generate HTML back out or lout to 
generate nice looking PDF :)  Hhmmm...so much to do, so much 
tendonitis. ;)

Suggesting for rebuilding the website (structure suggestions that is)?

On unix they run 100% smooth... So there's probably some option/environment

What did the config.log say? Check that you can compile the following on
your setup:

public class Test {
}

That seems to fail.

On windows/dos I noticed several times the use of a -jar option to java to
run things. Sometimes this seemed to be the source of strange behaviour.
Could you try that out?

Hey all,

I did this a month or so ago.  The problem is that there is an assumption in
the configure script that the CLASSPATH separator was ":".  However on
Windows, it is ";" (to allow for drive letters, I guess).  If you change the
following line in the configure script, you'll be OK:

	CLASSPATH=CLASSPATH:.

to

	CLASSPATH=CLASSPATH;.

Cheers,
Doug Schaefer

Hey kids,
	A good start would be my Makefile/ETAGS generator which is already
on antlr.org, if you're trying to figure out the dependencies that .g files
have.

For grammar dependencies, you can look in the Ant task for ANTLR that I
posted here some time ago. I use there an ANTLR parser for ANTLR (I mean, .g
files :-) to find imported vocabulary files and other dependencies.

"Bad code gen with ^ or ! on tree root

Are the ^ and ! not implemented yet or they are gone forever?

Hi.  They are still there...just don't use ^ on the root...it's already 
a root.

Thank you Terence for the answer.
But what we got with the ! ?
I have the AST transformation rules that are ok with the 2.7.1 but the 2.7.2a2 generates err msgs as it is promised.
Should I change the rules or wait for the final 2.7.2?

Typical rule:

protected
me_to_s_literal[ MCall* pMC, TYPE_SP_T& spWS ]
{ assert( pMC );
  TYPE_SP_AST spR;
}
: #( spO:PP_TO_S_LITERAL!
       (   IDENT!
           { Some code
           }
         | PP_VA_ARGS!
           { Some code
           }
   )  )
   { Some code
   }
;

Thanks,
Alexander Lenski

Hmm...the ! on a root should be ok, right?  So, 2.7.2a2 doesn't like ! 
on the root?  what does it generate vs 2.7.1?

In 2.7.1, ! on a root caused the first child to become the root 
instead of having the child list being promoted a level.  That is,

#( A! B C D )

becomes

#( B C D )

instead of B C D.

The fix should show up in your diff of JavaCodeGen.java with my stuff.

Message-ID: <000d01c262ee$8754b810$a801a8c0@israel.crediview.com>

Hi,
I'm looking for a strong C++ parser in order to analyze C++ sources
(.CPP & .H files). I want to extract entities like: method declarations,
enum declaration, member declarations, methods invocation, etc. I have
no background in the ANTLR parser, therefore I'm looking for examples,
guides, and other documentation that may help me implement the outlined
requirements.
1.	Where can I find such docs/examples?
2.	Where can I find a C++ grammar that works with ANTLR?
 
 
Thanks,
  Robert Sherman

Subject: [antlr-interest] [BUG FIX] Generates bad empty lookahead test expression in C++
Message-ID: <amngl9+usom@eGroups.com>

Greetings,

Found the following bug but am unsure how to submit it. Here's the
skinny; if anyone knows a better place for me to send such stuff,
please let me know!

The problem occurs with the following (stripped-down) grammar:

-- begin test.g --

options {
    language="Cpp";
}

class TestLexer extends Lexer;

options {
    k=2;
    charVocabulary='\3'..'\377';
}

COMMENT
    : "/*"
      ( '*' ~'/' 
      | NEWLINE
      | ~('*'|'/'|'\n'|'\r') )*
      "*/"
    ;

NEWLINE: '\r' ('\n')? | '\n' { newline(); };

-- end test.g --

There is a nondeterminism in NEWLINE which generates the following
lookahead tests in the corresponding lexer method, mNEWLINE.  The
problem is that the "if (true)" is missing parentheses, so the file
doesn't compile.

-- begin TestLexer.cpp:134-149 --

case static_cast<unsigned char>('\r'):
	{
		match(static_cast<unsigned char>('\r'));
		{
		if ((LA(1)==static_cast<unsigned char>('\n')) && (true)) {
			match(static_cast<unsigned char>('\n'));
		}
		else if true {     // <-- should be (true)
		}
		else {
			throw ...
		}
		}
		break;
	}

-- end TestLexer.cpp --

I propose the following patch:

CppCodeGenerator.java:3584
< return "true";
> return "(true)";

as this seems to generate the correct C++ code.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Understanding error: Label 'XX' has already been defined
Message-ID: <amnvbr+14k2@eGroups.com>

Hi relatives in trade,  

I posted the following question on jGuru a few days ago and got 
prompt answer from Monty (thanks again). Sounds like ultimate 
solution will require work in the Code Generator.

I still hope to find somebody who ran into similar behaviour
and may have some ideas on the grammar level ...
The following is my original message to jGuru:

---------------------------------------------------------
There is an existing grammar file (lets say My.g) - that was 
originaly processed with Antlr 2.6.1. 
I'm working on upgrade of the grammar, but prior to appending 
grammar I would like to  recompile My.g with latest Antlr 2.7.2A2 
But there are number of errors:

   "My.g:###:##: Label 'a' has already been defined. 
    Exiting due to errors."

in all rules of the following nature: (skinned) 

CaseNodes returns [CMyNode *pNode]
    {  pNode = NULL ; }
    :
    "null"      { pNode = new CMyNode(CMyNode::Null); }
    |a:CASE1   { pNode = new CMyNode(CMyNode::case1); }
    |a:CASE2   { pNode = new CMyNode(CMyNode::case2); }
    |a:CASE3   { pNode = new CMyNode(CMyNode::case3); }
    |a:DEFAULT { pNode = new CMyNode(CMyNode::dflt ); }
    . . .
    { pNode->t_ = a;  }
;

I figured if I modify this rule to be:

CaseNodes returns [CMyNode *pNode]
    {  pExpr = NULL ; }
    :
    "null"    {pNode = new CMyNode(CMyNode::Null); }
    |a:CASE1  {pNode = new CMyNode(CMyNode::case1); pNode->t_ = a; }
    |a1:CASE2 {pNode = new CMyNode(CMyNode::case2); pNode->t_ = a1;}
    |a2:CASE3 {pNode = new CMyNode(CMyNode::case3); . . .}
    |a3:DEFAULT{pNode = new CMyNode(CMyNode::dflt ); . . .}
    . . .
;
errors are gone , but this will trigger lots of changes in the 
existing grammar file, and can be are very messy.

What is the reason to changes in labels-related code generation 
(in 2.7) ? Is there is another way to approach it ?

Thank you, 

Dmitriy Neyman

The issue is that labels are used for exceptions too and hence must be 
unique per method so that you can specify a catch on one of those 
labels.  Or am I confusing myself with PCCTS.  Hmm....haven't looked at 
that in a while.  It's probably also an issue of where the labels are 
defined.

Subject: [antlr-interest] syntacsis vs. semantic
Message-ID: <amp57s+bjv5@eGroups.com>

Is there any recomendations about such common problem ?

There is ABSTRACT grammar:
 rule:  
      (A)? (B)? X
    | (B)? (C)? Y
    | (A)? (B)? (C)? Z
   ;

SYNTACTIC implementation of this grammar look like this:
 a: (A)?;
 b: (B)?;
 c: (C)?;
 rule:
    ( a b X ) => a b X
   |( b c Y ) => b c Y
   |( a b c Z ) => a b c Z
   ; 

SEMANTIC implementation of this grammar look like this:
 rule:
   ( (a:A)? (b:B)? (c:C)? )
   (
      X { c == null }? 
    | Y { a == null }? 
    | Z
   )
   ;

When is better use first solution and when second?

Ter--

PCCTS allowed reuse of labels on AST nodes.  That was a useful (but 
undocumented) feature which helped to make grammars more readable--you 
could attach a common action to one of a set of alternative AST nodes 
rather than having to duplicate the action for each alternative (as 
can be seen from Dimitrey's example).  To accomplish the same thing in 
ANTLR 2, you have to add an AST variable declaration in a rule-level 
action and add assignment code to each alternative as in
             { AST a; }
             (      a1:FOO  { a = a1; }
             |      a2:FOO  { a = a2; }
             )  { a.setType(COMMON); }

before you can specify a common action for a set of alternatives.

It would be nice to bring back AST label reuse.

Hi ,

I was just wondering if there is an IDE / Editor  which would help in  writing the EBNF Grammar for ANTLR.

Just off the top of my head could you do want you want with a Token Stream 
class

ie something like:

public class IndentFilterStream implements TokenStream {

         protected TokenStream lexer = null;
         protected int level = 0;

         public IndentFilterStream(TokenStream in) {
                 lexer = in;
         }

         public Token nextToken() throws TokenStreamException {
                 Token t = lexer.nextToken();
                 if (t.getType() == NEWLINE) {
                         Token t2 = lexer.getToken();
                         if (t2.getType() == WHITESPACE) {
                                 int len = t2.getText().getLength();
                                 if (len > level) t2 = new Token(INDENT);
                                 if (len < level) t2 = new Token(DEDENT);
                                 level = len;
                         }
                         return 
t2;
                 }
                 return t;
         }
}

The above has some problems in that you would lose NEWLINE and some 
WHITESPACE tokens to the parser, but it is a start......

Subject: [antlr-interest] get rid of printing to System.err
Message-ID: <1032958759.5083.3.camel@dev12>

Hi, I'm new to this list.

I use antlr.Tool (2.7.2a3) as integrated tool in a multithreaded
application. My problem is that AntLR makes heavy use of printing to
System.err. I have to redirect this to the user. Unfortunately I cannot
use System.setErr(myErrorStream), because the application is
multithreaded.

Hence I probably have to change the antlr sources to allow the user to
set his/her own error stream in a ThreadLocal static variable or in some
other manner (e.g. as instance attribute of antlr.Tool).

I would like to have this changes integrated in the antlr sources, hence
I ask if those changes are appreciated. If not, please tell me what to
do instead.

Yes.  I'm using XEmacs 21.4 native version on W2k with antlr-mode 2.2.
There is also a Cygwin version of XEmacs.  GNU's Emacs also runs on NT I 
believe though I've not tried it recently.

Hi All,

Congratulations to Terr, Ric and the others guys that work on this 
great tool.

I have a litle (I hope) question.

Examining the Java grammar from the main Antlr site (www.antlr.org), 
I saw that comments are just skipped there. Please, could someone 
give me some hints about incorporating comments and getting it into 
the final AST? All my tries produce a lot of non-determinisms and I 
don't know how to resolve them.

How could I insert the handling of comments in the syntax, since 
comments can appear everywhere?

Thanks to all.

There are examples of this on the antlr.org site. and also see

Subject: [antlr-interest] How to construct AST for C/C++ grammar given in issue#3.
Message-ID: <an1n63+54rk@eGroups.com>

We are students of Sacred Heart College(Tamil Nadu,India).

Our aim is to use ANTLR to develop a system called "Code 
Comparator"(ie. It compares two or more source codes according to 
their logic).

For that we planned to compare codes by generating the AST.

We tried to construct AST with the guidelines given in the "How to 
use ANTLR with C++" documents. (For the grammar given in the 
issue#3 "parser.g").

While building we got some errors in declaration. We made the 
changes given in the issue#4. But we couldn't find the main 
module.

Would you mind please send us the following files used to generate 
AST for the C/C++ grammar and steps to create the .exe file which 
will produce a AST for C/C++ files.

Files:
    PNode.hpp
    PNodeFactory.hpp
    Print_tree.hpp
    Main Module files ( Which are unknown to us )

We are eagerly waiting for your reply.

Thanking you,

Yours faithfully,

Freedom Soft Club Members,
Sacred Heart College,
Tirupattur,
TamilNadu,
India.

Howdy,

If anybody is interested, I'll be giving an ANTLR seminar at the 
University of San Francisco on Thursday October 24th at noon; Harney 
235.  Here's a general map (Harney is code HR off Golden Gate ave):

http://www.usfca.edu/online/gen_info/map_c.html

The 235 classroom is a 2.5$M "superclassroom" built by alumnus Alfred 
Chuang (yes, the BEA co-founder).  Pretty slick room.

Anyhoo, the talk will be targeted to undergraduates so expect a taste 
of antlr not any of the latest goodies.  I'll probably show off by 
building a full stack-machine compiler for a simple language on the fly 
<snicker>.  Any suggestions for the talk are welcome.  I'll be 
advertising the grad language class I'm teaching next semester too, 
which some of you might also be interested in.

Anybody who wants to show up and heckle, come on by.  I'll probably 
grab some lunch right after the talk from about 1 to 2.  Let me know if 
you plan on coming by so I can bring my carnivore proof suit.

Regards,
Ter

Subject: [antlr-interest] Is it possible to treat a non-literal like a literal?
Message-ID: <an5b3a+7uts@eGroups.com>

I'm still working on that IMAP nonsense.

Basically my problem is parsing something like this:

001 UID FETCH 1:* (BLAH UID BLAH)

The first appearnces of 'UID' is a command, the second is a string.  
The way I've been doing things so far, 'UID' is a literal (as are all 
commands).  It looks like I need to do something else, because I want 
any appearence of a command name after the actual command name to be 
treated as a string.

I suppose I could replace every reference to UID and other commands 
in the 
parser with some sort of ugly lookahead that verifies the text 
says 'UID' and than parse it as a string instead of a literal (the 
command names 
just get discarded anyway).

That sounds pretty ugly, though.  Is there another way?

Thanks.

Howdy.  The grad language class will cover the nature of computer 
languages (not design...rather we'll talk about their structure), how 
to recognize them, how to interpret them, and how to translate them.  
Lots of practical experience building grammars / translators. :)

I can only guarantee this class next semester.  I plan on continuing to 
teach part or full time but that course might only be offered in Spring 
semester. :(  It'll be M/W 1:15 to 3pm.

Terence

I promised a link to an ANTLR tutorial I wrote a while
back, so here it is:

http://supportweb.cs.bham.ac.uk/documentation/tutorials/docsystem/build/tuto
rials/antlr/antlrhome.html

If for some ludicrous reason this is only accessable from computers
within my netblock (the university sometimes does this), I can zip the
PDF and XHTML versions and post them as an attachment to the
list.

There are bound to be mistakes in the documentation, since I was
really only a begginner in it when I wrote it, if you let me know about
these mistakes via the online form on the website directly this would
be the best method because then they will get put into a database where
I can deal with them when I get the time.

I am entering my second year now, I work, pretty hard so time may be
scarce so mistakes may take a while to get fixed.

I seem to have found an acceptable solution by overriding 
testLiteralsTable(int).  The lexer is now always either expecting a 
command or not expecting one, and the state changes when it comes 
across commands and CRLF.  The overriden version calls the superclass 
version only if it is expecting a command.

That is a sensible solution to your problem.  You are lucky that you can
handle it in your lexer.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Getting token text - simple?
Message-ID: <ana3ap+fq6q@eGroups.com>

Hi,

I've had some fun with PCCTS 1.33 on a couple of projects and now 
have started with ANTLR 2.7.1 producing C++ code.
I have a typically trivial (I hope) newbie problem.
How do I get the token text, where I'm looking at attribute values.  
My code is the html.g as distributed with the following modification:

protected
ATTR
options {ignore=WS_;}
    :   WORD ('=' (axa:WORD ('%')? | ('-')? INT | bxb:STRING | 
HEXNUM))?
    {
        if( axa != NULL )
            printf( "<<A:attribute>><%s>", axa.getText());
        if( bxb != NULL )
            printf( "<<B:attribute>><%s>", bxb.getText());
	}
	;

I get the message:
(file/line) error C2039: 'getText' : is not a member 
of 'RefCount<class antlr::Token>'
..should I be deriving my own token class ?

Thanks

Dave Johnson

[Trey Spiva] 
It should be 

axa->getText()
 
axa is an instance of a RefToken which is defined as

typedef RefCount < Token > RefToken;

The template RefCount overrides the -> operator to allow 
access to the token.  Typical smart pointer stuff.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Parsing files in different charsets
Message-ID: <anbdvt+7cqd@eGroups.com>

   Hi,

how can I make ANTLR parse files containing different codepage as is 
its system codepage. For clarity, my system codepage is Cp1250, files 
contains string in Cp852 though identifiers are just from plain ASCII.
My problem is, that strings returned from calling getText method 
contains unrecognized characters.

If is enough to provide ANTLRLexer java.io.Reader reading in Cp852 ? 
How will be string tokens encoded after I will call getText on them ? 
If I am correct, then with these settings all charcters and tokens 
listed in grammar files have to be written in Cp852 ?

Or better way is to translate whole input stream into UTF8 and in 
this codeset also write grammar file ?

Thanks.
