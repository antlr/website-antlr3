<PRE>hi.  Sam Harwell had the great idea that I should commission a logo or logos for the ANTLR project. Perhaps there is a similar and consistent logo design for the individual tools. I'm also considering a new layout and design for the website. Basically v4 will have major new functionality and I want to do some nice branding for it. Sam also recommend someone that seems very good for doing the logo design. Questionnaire I have to fill out for this designer, however, asks questions that I don't really know how to answer exactly. I thought that I should appeal to you folks in the community so that we can  hone the answers for the designer to get something nice. Here are some questions that you might know the answer to or have opinions on:

1. what existing logos do we like and why

2.  what logos do we dislike and why

3. Preferred typography (heavy, light, modern, classic, handwritten etc.)  maybe we don't want text in the logo at all, but it seems like .g and .st could work in the individual tool logos. Microsoft logos for example:


Here is the logo portfolio of the guy:

 any and all thoughts about branding are welcome.
