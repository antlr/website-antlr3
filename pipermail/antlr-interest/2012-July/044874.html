<PRE>Howdy,

people are now submitting nice pull request to the ANTLR project software, but I have to keep the license clean. That's why I used to accept things through the feedback page:

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/misc/feedback">http://www.antlr.org/misc/feedback</A>

or with the contributors license agreement. I submitted a feature request to github to add such a license granting clause to the pull requests. they like the idea, but I haven't heard back about implementation.

What if we set up a webpage similar to the feedback page (current text enclosed at the bottom) with a text box where people can submit a URL to a pull request, certifying the origin of the material in that pull request.  The name/username/email etc. would have to match&#8230;very messy.

As a result of the certificate of origin, I could automatically post a comment to the pull request so that it somehow links the certificate.

Does anybody have any process or legal advice?
