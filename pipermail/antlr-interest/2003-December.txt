Do you have lexer and parser in one file ? I have them in separate files
and get no warnings.

Doing this in the tree construction stuff is probably not a good idea.
There's no unique mapping from AST type (e.g. as returned by getType()
(first parameter of #[x,y]) and the text (as returned by getText(), 2nd
parameter). So this can easily blow up. (As Thomas Brandon already pointed
out if I recall right)

Another reason against it is the crummy action parser interface in antlr
I'd rather not see this added on top of that (at least I won't touch it
with a 100ft pole after that happens unless its completely rewritten :)
that piece of code is enough of a horror already :(

OK, than maybe a future enhancement (maniac :)? 

Yet, if you feel it can easily break, I'll take your word for that (hope as 
time goes I'll get it ;).

2 files, lexer imports parser's vocab (a lot of keywords, not that I like it).

I attached a small example.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Any ready smart recovering from parsing errors?
Message-ID: <bqftm9+apqk@eGroups.com>

Hi, All!

Does anyone has any ready techniques of parsing errors recovering of
the same strength as some time earlier mentioned Cocktail Compiler
Toolbox?

What I need, is to recover as much of the code as possible without
loosing any single token (ok, it is a super goal, but it would be
really great).
E.g. it should be able to parse such code with reporting just 2 minor
problems:
public void method() {
  if (x < y
    super.method()
  }
}

It was said, that it is possible to port the code of that Cocktail
compiler into Antlr? Has anyone tried to do it actually? At least
anything?

As an alternative, I've seen also some notes about FOLLOW and FIRST
bit sets, which generally allow "as much as Cocktail does, but with
even greater flexibility". First of all, can not find these sets :(
And the second, it is really great to know that "it is possible", but
it would be even better to see it working! Any real examples
(especially for java.g)? Or good detailed descriptions of how to do
it?

I understand, that I can sit, take a month and get it working. The
problem is usual...

Hopefully waiting for your suggestions,
Anton

Hi,

I tried downloading and installing the above service pack and I 
still can't get case-insensitivity to work.  Here are the steps I 
followed:

1) I copied the new files to their proper folders
2) I ran build-actions.bat
3) I ran build-codegen.bat
4) I rebuilt the csharp/src/antlr-runtime-2.7.2.csproj project and 
verified that a new antlr-runtime.dll was created.
5) I recompiled my grammar file and my application.

Is there something I missed?

Thanks

What happens when you try to use your grammar?. Do you get
lexing/parsing errors?. Can you forward me a copy of the grammar/project?

Subject: [antlr-interest] buildTokenTypeASTClassMap() in derived parser
Message-ID: <000c01c3b8ab$72e2f220$6401a8c0@Epsilon>

Hello,

I have a base parser with a tokens section.
I want specialized AST nodes, so I tried to duplicate the token in the
derived parser with the <AST=nnn> but that gives me a compiler error.
Adding the AST modifier to the base parser doesn't help as this isn't copied
into the derived parser.
Do I need to use
parser.getASTFactory().setTokenTypeASTNodeType(...);
and do it all manually, or am I missing an easier/natural way to do this
directly in my grammar?

Thanks
-Ed

This is really cool!  Any chance of getting the actual tokens matched by the
rule in that derivation?  That's the other thing I look at when using
-traceParser.  

As for a test harness--yeah, that's cool for just doing parsers, but my
preferred approach, a la the GCC toolkit
http://www.codetransform.com/gcc.html, is to go from source to source and
then make sure you've got the same thing (minus some whitespace).

Well, for now it's just an "article" on the website with some sample 
code...later we'd have to allow people to specify their own parse tree 
nodes instead of my simple ones...  As for user programmable, for now, 
you can turn on or off by adding the overrides and turning on/off 
-traceParser.

Heh yeah!  That's a great idea, dude!  Sweet!  This way we can check to 
see if all derivation steps are identical.  Previously, testing parsers 
was really hard as it says yes or no depending on errors; that's all.   
  Answering "yes" is not much of a test as an empty main program gives 
the same answer. ;)  Yeah!  This is the testing harness I've been 
afraid would be extremely difficult!  We've got it, by jove!

These should be available via $FIRST or $FIRST(rulename) and $FOLLOW or
$FOLLOW(rulename). They give the names of the bitsets internally used for
the match/consume/consumeUntil/etc methods. Should be documented in 2.7.2
release notes and runtime.html.

I don't know of any examples. If you grab a copy of the public cocktail
toolbox and check for the docs on the LL(1) parser (ell.ps) it contains a
description of how ell does error recovery and how the sets are calculated.
It might take some hacking to completely implement it since the 'repair'
mode from ell is not present in antlr. Atm I have no clue wether it could be
emulated or not. If you have trouble finding the doc from ell drop me a
line I still have a copy lying about.

Cheers,

Ric

Sure...I'll combine with my TokenStreamTracker (next little goodie to 
release, which is an extension / simplification of the "preserving 
token order with trees" article).

That is more functional that unit testing...unit testing in *addition* 
could be good so we can more precisely identify where the problem is.  
The functional testing would test more of the translation rather than 
the parsing....good to have both. :)

If you label a token reference and then attach an exception, I think  
you can tell it to do some interesting things like when to consume til  
end of rule (i.e., give up) or don't consume anything and keep going  
(they just forgot a token)...etc...

The error I get when parsing is this:

  expecting "select", found 'Select'

You can download a copy of my sample grammar file and C# project

Yeah, I guess it depends on what your "unit" is.  Rules aren't really
methods, they're too interdependent, so a rule test just doesn't fly.  But
if you want to say your unit is a parser, then, OK I buy that.  My unit is a
"feature" like typedef or nested conditionals.  Boy this is a bogus
argument.  Never mind.

Somewhere my point was going to be that changing your parser around to
accommodate tree building will break your derivation and hence your unit
test.  So they need to be easy to fix.

However I'm looking forward to thrashing out a viable testing strategy for
parsers and translators.  For C, anyway, it's not been a problem to have
entire programs be the "unit" tested because they can still be small.

Sure...I'll combine with my TokenStreamTracker (next little goodie to

That is more functional that unit testing...unit testing in *addition* 
could be good so we can more precisely identify where the problem is.  
The functional testing would test more of the translation rather than 
the parsing....good to have both. :)

Exactly what I want though.  I want to test ANTLR's parser generation.  
The same grammar should give the exact same derivation.  A change in 
the grammar should be a different test. :)

True, but I need lower-level testing every time I tweak subrule 
recognition, for example.

Should be fun building a test harness :)

Actually, the line of thought is useful.  The differences are semantic--you're thinking in terms of diagnostic units, while Ter is talking 
implementation units.  The big advantage of source-to-source translation for testing is that the output is readily comprehensible by 
humans and you can put together simple diagnostic test cases.  That's still very much functional testing--the translator is treated as a 
black box.  The grammar testing (that Ter's made a strong start at) tests a grammar as an implementation unit, with enough visibility 
to get "rule" level diagnostic information.  I put "rule" in quotes because the problems are usually interactions between rules, not 
necessarily local to a rule.

The pieces still missing are the token (source) mapping that you suggested, and some useful presentation of ANTLR decision 
making.  Interestingly, Ter's approach would print flattened rules, and you'd also want a syntax tree to parse tree mapping.  (My tree 
grammar generation stuff might be adequate, but I think that there's a better approach lurking here.)  Printing $FIRST and $FOLLOW 
sets would be overwhelming; there must be some useful way of extracting the equivalent diagnostic information in a comprehensible 
form.

I have a Perl script that "parses" a file into a memory structure.
I'm learning Java and wanted to convert the functionality into Java.
Antlr seems to be the tool for the job. I'm not sure I understand the best
way to use it though.

If the file looks like:-

DES  MAIL1 
TN   001 0 02 00 
TYPE SL1 
CDEN DD
CUST 0 
KLS  1 
FDN  
TGAR 0 
LDN  NO
NCOS 4 
SGRP 0 
RNPG 0

What is the best way to configure the parser and lexer.

I have tried the following grammar on a simple file and it seems to work.
Most of the recognising is done based on the literal word at the beginning
of the line. Is this the best way to approach this problem?:-

class TNBParser extends Parser;
options { k = 4;
		  defaultErrorHandler = true;
	    }
	    //A tnbfile consists of one or more tnbrecords
tnbfile
  :
   (record)+
   EOF
  ;

record
  :
   (des)*
   (tn)?
   date
  ;
  
des : (d:DES) {System.out.println("DES: " + d.getText());};
tn : (t:TN){System.out.println("TN: " + t.getText());};
date :(da:DATE){System.out.println("DATE: " + da.getText());};	
//anything:(az:ALPHA|SP)*{System.out.println("ANYTHING: " + az.getText());};


class TNBLexer extends Lexer;
options { k = 3;
		  defaultErrorHandler = true;
		  //charVocabulary = '\3'..'\377';
		  //testLiterals=true;
		  //caseSensitive = false;
	      //caseSensitiveLiterals = false;
    	  charVocabulary='\u0000'..'\uFFFE';
    	  filter=IGNORE;
	    }
// TNB is mostly uppercase but we need lowercase in here because of the CPND
// How do we define it so we can break it up in key value pairs in the
parser


TN:"TN"(SP)+(INT)+(SP)*(INT)*(SP)*(INT)*(SP)*(INT)*;

Simon--

Think of doing more in the parser using the lexer to tokenize the arguments on the line using whitespace as separators.  Something 
like

des
    :
    "DES" (NUMBER | TEXT)* NEWLINE
    ;

Then you've already sorted out the arguments and can avoid re-lexing the line contents.  That will give you more processing flexibility.

I just had a quick look at the generated source for the lexer in your
project. It seems to have been generated by a pre-SP1 version of
ANTLR/C# 2.7.2.

In the method initialize(), the SP1 version generates code to create
the literals table with a line like:

literals = new Hashtable(CaseInsensitiveHashCodeProvider.Default,
CaseInsensitiveComparer.Default);

This is not the case with your project. Did you have some problem with
building ANTLR/C# (after you applied SP1)?. ANTLR 2.7.2 has it's own
build tool. Please see the installation docs supplied with ANTLR for
info about the build tool. The C# runtime library will then need to be
built separately.

Cheers,

Micheal
ANTLR/C#

Subject: [antlr-interest] code instrumentation with Monty's C grammar
Message-ID: <bqndk7+mmor@eGroups.com>

Hi All,

I have to do C-code instrumentation to measure the decision coverage
of a software. I think Monty's C-grammar is the right thing for me. I
think I could do the instrumentation with some changes in the
GnuCEmitter.g file, eg. I could change the rule in the grammar where
the if-clause is printed. 

Example:
// Selection statements:
        |       #( i:"if"    { print( i ); print( "(" ); }
                 expr        { print( ")" ); print("{ counter++; "); }
                statement    { print("}");}
                (  e:"else"  { print( e ); print( "(" ); }
                   statement { print("}");}
                )?
                )

But I have one big problem: I must not instrument all the functions
and all the if-statements in the software. There are some functions
with a special function name (eg. _L1_...) that should not be
instrumented. And there are some special if-statements with
automatically generated code that prevents from divisions by 0. 
Is it possible to check for the functionname or the content of the
if-expression before instrumenting the if-statement? What do I have to
change? Can you please give me an example?!

Thank you very much!

P.S.: Sorry for my bad English!

Daniel--

Take a look at ANTLR's semantic and syntactic predicates.  The semantic predicates will be useful to identify the functions to be 
ignored, while syntactic predicates can be used to identify the automatically generated if statements.  Mostly, you will need to 
duplicate existing rules or alternatives, insert actions in one of the duplicates, and add predicates to determine which version to 
invoke.  You may want to add an intermediate tree transformation step to insert the instrumentation function calls before invoking the 
emitter, or you may modify the emitter to identify the special cases.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Swapping root node
Message-ID: <000501c3bbb7$a687e900$6601a8c0@Epsilon>

Hello,

I am creating a heterogenous tree. Is there an easy way to swap a root. For
example:
lp:LPAREN^ (param_list)? rp:RPAREN!
// This is base AST node, need to put my own in
// { #lp.setType(METHOD_CALL); #lp.setText("method_call"); }
{
AST children = astFactory.dupList(#lp.getFirstChild());
## = #([METHOD_CALL, "method_call"], children);
}

Is there no 'cleaner' way? Is there a more detailed doc about AST
manipulation somewhere? I am doing a few transformations to make my back end
code gen simpler, and I am not sure if my 'scary' looking code is the normal
way to do it :) it works though.

Also, why does this fail:
## = #([METHOD_CALL, "method_call"],
astFactory.dupList(#lp.getFirstChild()));
The #lp.getFirstChild() compiles to lp.getFirstChild(), I expected
lp_AST.getFirstChild().

Thanks
-Ed

Subject: [antlr-interest] Bad Token-type to AST-Class map in 2.7.2 Java; broken release
Message-ID: <bqs0qt+aurb@eGroups.com>

Hi, just diagnosed 2.7.2 as problematic and gone back to 2.7.0.

Problem is tokens declared with string literal:

IMPORT_ON_DEMAND          <AST=persist.qtree.Node>;
THIS = "this"             <AST=persist.qtree.ThisExpr>;
ASCENDING = "ascending"   <AST=persist.qtree.AscendingOrderingExpr>;

Generates a broken TokenType to AST ClassMap.

tokenTypeToASTClassMap.put(new Integer(IMPORT_ON_DEMAND),
  persist.qtree.Node.class);
tokenTypeToASTClassMap.put(new Integer("this"),
  persist.qtree.ThisExpr.class);
tokenTypeToASTClassMap.put(new Integer("ascending"),
  persist.qtree.AscendingOrderingExpr.class);

Note that tokens without string (literals?) assigned are OK as they 
are mapping by integer constants; but tokens with strings are 
generated broken with the strings as map IDs.

Proceeding with 2.7.0 for now. Anyone else seen this problem?


Regards,
Thomas

Ed--

Until we can get 2.8e (e for experimental) out (January is likely), 
you're stuck with this approach.  2.8e will provide a target-
language independent (excepting construction predicates) syntax for 
rewriting trees.

For your example, change #lp to #lp_in; that will get you the input 
AST for duplication.

Howdy.  I just added RSS (version 0.91) to the site for entity types: 
article, grammar, share, showcase, and testimonial.  My blogs do not 
have an RSS feed yet as they are currently just flat files.

You'll find links on the pages that have RSS feeds.  Please let me know 
if I spit out usable stuff.

BTW, StringTemplate does a lovely job to spitting RSS out :)

I'm guessing, given the access pattern (boatloads a second), that it's 
a dufus with a runaway script.

Subject: [antlr-interest] feature request:  Token.getOffset()
Message-ID: <bqtqso+f6ou@eGroups.com>

Hi Antlr Maintainers,

For my purposes currently it's more important to have the absolute
offset into the input file for each token than to have the
line/column.  To get what I want I've been calling

lexer.setColumn(0);
lexer.setTabSize(1);

before the parse and then calls to getColumn() return the offset I
need.  But this means I never call newline() because that would reset
the column counter and thus I can't have line/column info if I want
it.

I think that it would be nice and easy have it both ways.  We would
just need to add getOffset() and setOffset() to Token and then have
LexerSharedInputState manage an offset counter independently of the
line/column counters.

Does that make sense?  Am I totally missing something here (i.e. is
the offset info I need already available somewhere)?

How about: override tab() to keep a correction value for column 
information, and override newline() to track offset for the start of 
the current line.  Then you can compute the character offset 
yourself: (line start offset + column - correction) should work 
using the token's column information since the correction only 
changes at tabs.

Adding more state to the lexer is something that is better avoided.

I see how this could work by overriding tab() and newline(), but I was 
thinking tracking absolute offset could be generally useful - so why 
not put it into the codebase.  And I doubt that adding an int and 
incrementing it in a couple of places (where column is currently 
changed in CharScanner) is going to affect performance or 
maintainability.

Here's another angle: isn't offset a more fundamental measure than 
line/column to begin with?  I mean your input source could be bits, 
bytes, chars, nodes or whatever and line/column may not have any
meaning in some of those cases, but offset is your way of tracking
a token back to its place in the input source.

just my 2 bits...

I'm not convinced--editors tend to present a line/column view of 
text, which is why it makes sense to support keeping that 
information for mapping errors to input.  There aren't many tools 
routinely used that do the same with absolute offsets.

Absolute offset does not have the same utility, and it is a good 
idea for the lexer to track minimal state information--the tracking 
affects lexer performance.  ANTLR 2 lexers are slow enough as it is 
(ANTLR 3 should fix that--Ter's working on a few optimizations.

It may not seem like much, but it is a counter incremented for each 
character, and the optimum is to test a character and move to the 
next unless the end of a token has been reached.  There could be a 
20% performance hit from maintaining another character counter--
better not to add that as a matter of course and reconstruct it from 
the line/column support when needed.

Message-ID: <20031208020541.36276.qmail@web80710.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all
 
I am new to ANTLR and am currently trying to get it to compile on VC6. I am following Peter Morling's tutorial at http://www.imada.sdu.dk/~morling/issue1.htm
 
I am using the latest version of ANTLR, 2.7.2. The dsw and dsp files in D:\antlr-2.7.2\lib\cpp that comes with the zip file appears to be outdated, as they referenced non existant source files, so I created my own, following the first 5 steps of the tutorial.
 
When I tried to build the ANTLR static library at step 6, I got numerous warnings, plus the following 4 errors :
 
lib\cpp\src\treeparser.cpp(39) : error C2491: 'TreeParser::ASTNULL' : definition of dllimport static data member not allowed
lib\cpp\src\baseast.cpp(312) : error C2201: 'nullASTptr' : must have external linkage in order to be exported/imported
lib\cpp\src\token.cpp(18) : error C2720: 'badToken' : '__declspec(dllimport ) ' storage-class specifier illegal on members
lib\cpp\src\token.cpp(18) : error C2491: 'Token::badToken' : definition of dllimport static data member not allowed
 
Has anyone else encountered this problem? Some help will be greating appreciated :)

Subject: [antlr-interest] What about grammar inheritance?
Message-ID: <008601c3bd61$e8f7b0d0$0100a8c0@Daemon>

On the antlr website, the paper "ANTLR 3 Whitepaper" 
mentions "dropping inheritance" as one of the features of 
ANTLR 3.

Will there be an alternative grammar re-use mechanism
in ANTLR 3?

We use grammar inheritance extensively to model differences 
in language dialects (e.g. different Cobol dialects, etc.). This
is a feature I would not like to lose. In fact, it was one of the
reasons for us to go with ANTLR.

I can add, that I was disappointed with the way grammar inheritance made...

For example, we have SQL parser for our Valentina database.
This parser include of course EXPRESSION parsing part.

But in Database we have also part, where we need ONLY EXPR part.

When I have read docs of ANTLR I did expect that if I make grammars

    EXPR 
    SQL : inherited from EXPR


Then I will get 2 C++ classes

    EXPR
    {
    }

    SQL : EXPR
    {

    }

But in second case I get just class SQL with all the same methods.
This is NOT GOOD.

For now I did go just with one SQL class, and simply use as entry point
expr() method. This works well, and no overhead not by code size not by
performance

Get a developer snapshot at http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr/

You'll have to make the dsp/dsw's yourself, follow the instructions from
lib/cpp/README mostly (about the defines that need (not) to be defined).
(Don't include dll.cpp in the project)

You will get some errors in several header files on some vc7/7.1 stuff
stuff about _Tree_nod, Tmap_traits and similar names (already instantiated
or something like that) just remove those lines or #ifdef 0 them. Most of
these should look something like 

#if defined(_MSC_VER) && !defined(__ICL) // Microsoft Visual C++
  template class ANTLR_API ASTRefCount< AST >;
  template class ANTLR_API ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(std)allocator< RefAST >;
  template class ANTLR_API ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(std)vector< RefAST >;
//template ANTLR_API int operator<( ASTRefCount< AST >, ASTRefCount< AST > );
#endif

Don't try to make a DLL with MSVC 6. See mailling list archive as to why.

Cheers,

Ric

You could override newline in your lexer if you don't care about the column
offset? Then again it's a bit on the hackish side.. Loring's solution is a
bit nicer with respect to that...

Sometimes it could be handy... although you'd maybe also want to track the
filename then in case you'd use some include file mechanism.. and ... and ..
Though I wonder how hard it would be implementing it in the current
framework.

> Does that make sense?  Am I totally missing something here (i.e. is

You can probably make a cleaner solution by making a special inputbuffer
which tracks the offset look at CharBuffer (at least that's what it's
called in C++) keep in mind that due to guessing you (probably) cannot just
proxy the stream offset (or java equivalent of that) this might take some
tweaking to InputBuffer (not 100% sure, if so patches adding a generic way
to extend functionality there would be welcome)

After you get a custom InputBuffer going, you can use a custom token class
and factory. Set those in the lexer, you also need to override makeToken to
create tokens with offsets. A little more work is now needed to set up the
parser/lexer (creating the inputstates).

Hmmm come to think of it.. you might already get it to work by directly
correcting the stream offset by the number of entries in the InputBuffer
queue in makeToken (combined with a custom token and its factory) unless
I'm overlooking something within the rewind/commit stuff.

Generally though antlr is used in context of line/column info's, the
absolute offsets could be nice for some types of error reporting (quoting
bits of the surroundings of the error) Then again how many people use that
(or even the recently added column stuff). If the above solution(s) work(s)
then I don't see the use of adding it per default. An example or a
modification of an existing example with this trick would be welcome though
(if it works :) ).

(/grants loring permission to throw something at him) Hmmm so we can get up
to a 20% gain in our lexers by kicking out the column stuff ;) ? Or move
the checking of tabs out of the CharScanner::consume method and handle them
similarly to newline by explicit calls in the lexer?

Cheers,

Ric

I for one use something like that for parsing files. This allows for a
two-pass parsing scheme that skips contents of functions or similar 
etc. in the first pass but stores information about the whereabouts at the
nodes so that the second pass can start right there when the contents of a
function are required.
Putting it into the parser was quite some work (especially in combination
with input streams that translate some other encoding to unicode) and is
probably not pretty reusable (not even extractable ...).

So I could use such a feature from time to time, say by specifying an 
option in the grammar header.
And I guess line and column info is not so useful when parsing binary
files so making them optional (but on per default) could be useful.

No thanks Paul. Having to delete a couple of harmless spam messages a
week is a much safer prospect than delegating moderator
control/responsibility/access to a stranger.

This is not possible.  It will have SQL + EXPR methods and must be this 
way as changing a rule in subclass can affect code gen for rules 
inherited from super.

I don't understand what the "Grammar reuse via RCS concepts" idea is.

I think I mentioned this before, but I'll mention it again. SDF/SDF2 has a
really good grammar module system that is much more flexible than ANTLR's
current grammar inheritence system. Whereas ANTLR's system is similar to subtype
polymorphism (subclassing), SDF's mechanism is more like parametrically
polymorphism (generics). You are encouraged to break up your grammar into
reusable pieces, which you can then assemble in different ways, overriding and
parameterizing rules as necessary. 

For a simple example, let's say you have a module for the lexical syntaxes of a
bunch of languages; e.g. Java, C#, Standard ML, Lisp, CORBA IDL, etc. It is
commonly the case that any new language you create will have a lexical syntax
that is basically a combination of different subsets of these languages. So, it
seems you would want to do something like this (the meta-language is made up):

lexical grammar MyLanguageLexicalGramar is 
begin
    StringLiteral imported from SQL;       -- We love single quotes
    Identifier    imported from StandardML;-- why not allow primes in ID's
    Comment       imported from PLSQL;     -- the ultimate comment marker
end;
    
This is one very useful idea that is basically impossible to implement using
ANTLR's current inheritence system (no multiple inheritence). It is easily done
in SDF2's module system. Also, the rule template mechanism I suggested a long
time ago can be implemented through this module system--each template rule is
just a parameterized (sub-)module.

Hi Brian,

Yep, that's what I meant by delegations.

lexer JavaLexer;

delegate ID, INT, FLOAT to CGrammar;
....

Interesting.  I'll bring this back up when I get more into the overall 
functionality...i'm still working on the engine.

The 20% would require heavy optimization of the lexer--right now, ANTLR lexers are grossly inefficient.  Handling tab() like newline(), 
though, would be a good idea.  line/column information is generally useful (it's hard to imagine a production batch translator that didn't 
need the line/column error reporting for text processing.  Ter's working on doing a few things that should significantly improve ANTLR 
lexer performance.

Silvain--

I'm not sure that you have gotten a direct answer, although if you've read the follow-ups you'll notice a commitment to supporting reuse 
of grammar pieces.  The intent is to support a better mechanism for composing grammars, possibly at the workbench (IDE) level 
rather than at a grammar level.  The current inheritance mechanism is pretty clumsy.

As far as the current grammar inheritance mechanism is concerned, that's done in the preprocessor (antlr/preprocessor) to substitute 
rules.  I'm sure that you could maintain the preprocessor for backwards compatibility if you needed it.

Ter's been resistant so far to using the "moderate new users" setting.  I do have to say that Eroticy.com is pretty flagrant about

Actually the link on your home page does not go any where so I had to look

How do I drop old feed items?

Probably should have an RSS page since you can get RSS feeds from 
articles and grammars too.

It is simply unprofessional to fail to ensure that a widely-used 
list is spam-free.  Moreover, if the spam is X-rated, it can cause 
other types of problems (besides wasted time) for those who access 
the list at work or in a family setting.  I would certainly be very 
reluctant to recommend this list to a colleague.

Hi Ric
 
Thanks for the help. I downloaded the developer snapshot, and tried it with VC7. It managed to compile the static library successfully, though with some warnings.
 
I tried the calc example again. CalcTreeWalker.cpp and CalcParser.cpp generated by antlr will not compile, with a bunch of errors about missing identifers. There is also a couple of errors about unable to instantiate abstract class in Main.cpp
What am I doing wrong now? :(

The moderator is only listed as parrt2000, I do not know why he has 
still not responded to a request to moderate the list or let anyone 
interested to.

parrt2000 come out and lets clean the spammers from the list.

We already had this discussion like a month ago and he did respond. RTFA:
Threads "spam" and "spam/IRONIC." By the way, Terence Parr = parrt2000.
Unfortunately, the problem seems to be getting worse as (a) the quantity of spam
has increased a lot, and (b) the said spam is no longer hilarious as it was before.

Spam filtering tip: "[antlr-interest] i'm having an orgy party at my place" is
probably not the subject line of an email containing a detailed discourse on the
merits of predicated-LL(k) parsing.

Love,
Brian

Message-ID: <br3ptl+55ee@eGroups.com>

Well, thanks for all the suggestions, guys.

I think my application is actually somewhat similar to what Tom
Dudziak described in that I want to parse a file in several passes.  I
need the absolute offsets because the input data will be in a big
string (or stream) so I can seek to a given point to extract a
sub-section to parse (I would have marked the section boundary offsets
in an initial pass).

Also the editor I'm working with (the Eclipse IDE TextEditor) wants me
to give offset/length instead of line/column for things like
highlighting and selecting sections of text.  The only thing I would
need line/column for is parsing files that aren't open in the editor -
and I don't need that yet but probably will at some point.

Anyway, I'm still skeptical that counting offsets deep in the lexer
would affect performance much, but until I can come up with some test
cases that quantify the different approaches discussed here I'll keep
my mouth shut. :-)

Plus I've got a more bothersome problem with the interface of
RecognitionException.  See my next post on that....

Sorry folks.  I know SPAM sucks, but if you think moderating will help, 
you've not thought much about spam ;)  The only thing that will work is 
if I manually check each and every message not the user.  Sorry, but 
that would reduce the timeliness of this list and make it not nearly as 
good.  I've got enough work keeping the site up, writing articles for 
it, fixing bugs, doing the new version and doing my teaching gig.

I might as well spell out the problem: i can moderate so 
"sexy@ireallylikedoingnaughtythingstofarmanimals.com" can't post, but 
they will simply change their email address to 
"Paul_Selormey@hatesspam.com" or 
"dotlessbraille@iamnotwhoyouthinkiam.com".  The minute I block those, 
they reappear with a different email.  You are fighting a losing 
battle.  The only solution is to attack with DOS and have your ISP down 
on you or let's all start hammering the yahoo guys to attack these 
spammers since Loring says they are coming from the same place just 
different emails.

Shall we all flood the yahoo complaint email?

Surely you see that moderation is not an option.  May we dispense with 
this conversation about moderation now?

Let's get yahoo to do something.

your commiserating, but nonmoderator, ;)

Well, maybe not as bothersome as I thought.... :-)

I was going to say that I can't get to the token info for exceptions
that have a token associated with them (like MismatchedTokenException
and NoViableAltException), but now I see that Token is a public
instance variable in both cases so I *can* get to it.  I was looking
for something like getText() or getToken() and not seeing it, but the
public instance vars will work for me.

Now I would be a little happier if RecognitionException had a
getLength() or getText() to go along with getLine() and getColumn(),
but I can get what I need here by using instanceof and casting to the
specific exception type.

Ter--

I don't buy your argument.  I think that part of the reason for the 
eroticy.com choice of user names is to avoid legal problems and that 
moderation might scare them off.  As long as they use names 
indicative of content, they can claim that they were "invited" and 
not be vulnerable to lawsuit.  Advertising SPAM is for the purpose 
of making money; lawsuits are not a desired consequence on the part 
of the spammer.

Hello Terence,
Thanks for coming out. Well, you have missed the stuff.
The name is just one way to prevent it, but I will not discuss
all the tricks over the list since many of the spammers are still
registered on the list.

Now, to answer your question - yahoo has a feature when turned
on will enable you to moderate the first post of a new member. This is
a technical list and not everyone can just post "meaningfully" -
hope you are getting the picture. From the first post you know if the
person belongs here and could determine whether to keep him/her
on the list and the first post never gets to the list unless approved.

Best regards,
Paul.

Agreed, and the earlier we start the better. Otherwise we may
reach a stage that will make it difficult to clean the list due to
the number of members.

It is indeed very desirable that the list be spam-free. On the other
hand, since no individual or company I know can claim to be fully
spam-free, I don't see how the standards should be any different for
this list. Plus, any mesures taken to counter spam by
individuals/companies would also automatically work on mail received
from this list.

The spam (as I receive them) are text messages with a URL. What the
URL links to is irrelevant as both it and the message that contains it
are so obviously not ANTLR business.

This is an extreme position to be sure but, you are entitled to your
own opinion.

My own opinion is that if the spam-to-noise ratio increases, we should
try moderation (using long-time active members). If the moderation
loop seriously impacts on the send-receive roundtrip time, we should
stop it and advise members to install spam filters locally (which most
everyone already have anyways).

Micheal

It is a sound argument but I don't agree with his conclusion -
basically do nothing.

True but who has the time to track them down and file a suit?. Yahoo
certainly doesn't seem to care much.

No, I think the real motivator for introducing moderation is to
encourage spammers to look for an easier target first. Given the
number of mailing lists available, that should keep them at bay for a
while. Of course the question is, how would moderation impact the
communication here?. I know a group where it takes a couple of *days*
(or more) for a post to complete the moderation loop and appear on the
list. I'd rather have harmless occasional spam than that!

Cheers,

Micheal

Double check if you got all the right parts. E.g. the new support lib (did
you rebuild it? are you grabbing the right one?) and the new codegenerator ?

At first sight I'd say you're using the old support lib.

Cool. Ter, I volunteer as a moderator then. Just doesn't sound right
that a virtual stranger should fill that role (regardless of how long
he's been a lurker). ;-)

Hmmm ...

A "minimal expense" way of doing it at present would be to keep a
line-position count as you parse the line, then just add that to the
file-position count when you reset it in a newline.

Tabs are the fly in the ointment ... they increase the character count
by one, but the line count by some arbitrary amount ... I've always
hated tabs in text for that very reason.

Cheers,

The 20% would require heavy optimization of the lexer--right now, ANTLR
lexers are grossly inefficient.  Handling tab() like newline(), 
though, would be a good idea.  line/column information is generally
useful (it's hard to imagine a production batch translator that didn't 
need the line/column error reporting for text processing.  Ter's working
on doing a few things that should significantly improve ANTLR 
lexer performance.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Semantic Predicates inside syntactic ones?
Message-ID: <20031209115505.G4207@cs.utwente.nl>

Hi,

Okay I know there's other ways to solve my specific problem but I got to
wonder... (This probably has been discussed somewhere earlier but I could
not find relevant posts the search in yahoogroups is pretty crummy)

The situation: I want to pick out certain assignment expressions in a tree
walker to generate different output code from my tool. The old generic rule:

---snip----
assignment: 
   #( "=" lhs1:write_expr[output,false]      { output << "->setValue( "; }
          rhs1:write_expr[output,true] )
   {
      output << " )";
   }
---snip---

Now I need to detect assignments to a specific typed variable:

#( "=" IDENTIFIER ( INT | FLOAT ) )

Where the id is a clock typed variable and the INT/FLOAT is zero.
(clock reset in a process algebra)

I could of course generate different trees for this type of assignment (got
all the tools in my parser to do the trick there). But I want to keep
things as generic as possible since we will be targetting multiple
formalisms from our language.

So I wondered if I could do the following since it's not particularly
farfetched (omitted 0 check for brevity):

assignment: 
   ( #( "=" id:IDENTIFIER { isClock(#id->getSymbol() ) }? (INT|FLOAT) ) ) =>
      #( "=" IDENTIFIER ( INT | FLOAT ) )
   {
      // generate clock reset code
   }  
|  #( "=" write_expr[output,false]     { output << "->setValue( "; }
          write_expr[output,true] )
   {
      output << " )";
   }
| ... ;

Well to answer my question no I cannot do this with vanilla antlr. The code
for the semantic predicate is inserted correctly but ANTLR does not assign
to the referenced label (e.g. no id = _t) Being an antlr hacker I noticed
pretty quick that I can enable this trick by uncommenting a few odd checks
over the codegenerators.

Aside note: Currently it's btw pretty stupid that antlr does not generate
warnings for labels on tokens in syntactic predicates.. one for the todo
list...

Thoughts comments?

Cheers,

Ric

Actually.. it can be solved quite nice without antlr tampering by adding an
extra rule:

isClockReset returns [bool ok]:
	#( "=" id:IDENTIFIER	( i:INT | f:FLOAT ) )
	{
		double val;
		if( #i )
		{
			std::istringstream rf(#i->getText());
			rf >> val;
		}
		if( #f )
		{
			std::istringstream rf(#f->getText());
			rf >> val;
		}
		SymbolInformation* si = data.getModel()->getSymbolInformation();
		ok = si->is_clock(#id->getSymbol()) && val == 0;
	}
;
exception
	catch [antlr::RecognitionException &ex]
	{
		// prevent exceptions from obstructing things
		ok = false;
	}

assignment:
	{ isClockReset(#assignment_in) }? #( "=" lhs0:write_expr[output,false] ( INT | FLOAT ) )
	{
		output << "->setValue( model->getGlobalClock() )";
		varname_collector->execute( lhs0, vars );
	}
|	#( "=" lhs1:write_expr[output,false]		{ output << "->setValue( "; }
			 rhs1:write_expr[output,true] )
	{ output << " )"; }
| ...;

Guess the motto is if one predicate does not the work the other will, it's
only tedious that antlr does not help very much with this..

Cheers,

Ric

I don't see this option (looked twice).  I see only moderate 
subscription and I believe moderate each post, neither of which are 
what we want really.  I'm not sure we can have more than one moderator 
for postings...w/o that people around the world would have to wait for 
me all the time, which is not a good solution just because you get spam 
here like you do in regular email ('course I don't since I use 
http://www.knowspam.net ).

Can you give me a link to this feature?  It's still a bad deal because 
new people cannot ask a question and get an immediate answer.  Might 
have to wait up to a week when I go on vacation or off for the weekend.

I believe Ter is capable of working parsing miracles and would most
definitely rather he spend time doing that (ANTLR 3.0) and so would he
(just a guess on my part ;-).  The solution is then to delegate some of
those responsibilities.  However, it's Ter's list and he would have to
feel confident (trust) that the person(s) allowed to moderate would do
it to his satisfaction and are also willing participants.  If he chooses
not to moderate new users, the we can opt out of the list of our own
free will.
 
There are varying levels of access for delegated moderators on
yahoogroups.  I personally believe that simply enabling new member
approval on the list, the SPAM wpuld be cut about 99%, just because the
joining process is more involved and spammer's are lazy SOB's out for a
quick buck and are usually using e-mail accounts that either don't exist
or are not ones they monitor.  It would then be easy to root out and
delete any existing members that are there to spam us.
 
So, my suggestion would be to switch the list options to require
approval to join and make sure that only members can post.  Then give a
couple of existing, willing, able, and trustworth list members rights to
approve/disallow new members.  I believe that all membership moderators
will receive a copy of the new membership request e-mail's that includes
embedded web URL's to either allow or reject the new user.  I don't
believe it would take much additional time to work through new member
requests, nor to identify blatant abusers and delete them, especially if
these tasks are shared/offloaded from Ter's plate.
 

My old recreational lists lists on yahoogroups required approval to
join.  I had a few people try to join that were obviously not interested
in the list.  For some prospective members that looked suspicious, but
could have been valid requests, I would send an e-mail (from a special
account) asking why they would want to join.  If I didn't get a reponse,
or the response didn't make sense, I would reject them.  I got very few
abusers and those that tried were squashed quickly.  It is fairly easy
process given that the e-mail request includes quick links to allow or
reject the new user.

True but who has the time to track them down and file a suit?. Yahoo
certainly doesn't seem to care much.

No, I think the real motivator for introducing moderation is to
encourage spammers to look for an easier target first. Given the
number of mailing lists available, that should keep them at bay for a
while. Of course the question is, how would moderation impact the
communication here?. I know a group where it takes a couple of *days*
(or more) for a post to complete the moderation loop and appear on the
list. I'd rather have harmless occasional spam than that!

Cheers,

Micheal

Moderation on membership is useless as they will simply use john.smith 
as a username and we'll be none the wiser.

Moderation on each message is very unsatisfactory as we'd need perhaps 
3 moderators in perhaps 4 equidistant timezones to get decent response 
time on each posting.

Do you really want to add that work load given how much spam you get in 
your regular mailbox?  A trivial word filter on this list would be 
sufficient for all spam since you are not getting your regular personal 
email in this folder.  You're going to add a big load to remove 2 or 3 
spam a day?

I truly don't see how the antlr-list problem is different than your 
regular spam problem.

I agree.

I use very effective spam filtering (only about 10 in 2000/week get
through) but I let all this list through and just trash the obvious spam
without even opening it, so I have not seen the messages people are
referring to.  It is usually obvious from the subject line which ones are
spam.

I see limited amounts of unsolicited email spam--that's a side effect of working at a place in the .gov domain.  Misuse of federal 
equipment is a prosecutable offense, and complaints about spam are followed up; usually a warning is sufficient.  (I wish that worked 
for virus-laden emails from infected sources, but ...).  Most spam is not intentionally malicious--it is a form of advertising.  If you take 
no action to discourage unwanted advertising, you are seen by the advertisers as tacitly approving receipt of the material.  If you put 
up barriers which force the advertisers to demonstrate intent to abuse the system, they are likely to back off.

I disagree with the view that
> > Moderation on membership is useless as they will simply use john.smith
> > as a username and we'll be none the wiser.
because I believe that the spammers have the good sense not to leave themselves open to legal action--or even being banned from 
yahoo.  The converse is more likely to be true:  if you don't moderate, then you intentionally invite spam.  I was especially amused by 
the "I'm a nude model" (msg #10267) post which was apparently response to Ter's anti-moderation message (10266).  [No, I do not 
think that that was coincidence--I suspect that this is an active advertising campaign on the part of eroticy.com with human-in-the-loop 
posting, not a spambot.]  BTW, how about a test of the hypothesis that "moderation is useless":  if you can get a spammer to take 
demonstrably abusive action (get past the new user moderation in a trial period through use of an inocuous user name and initial post) 
and yahoo does not take action in response to a complaint about that action, then I'll accept the "moderation is useless" argument as 
valid.

Easy,
>>From the antlr page:
1. Click the "Management" link on the left
2. You will be presented with three categories, click the "Messages" in
     "Group Settings"
3. Move to the "Posting and Archives" and click "Edit"
4. Look at the "Moderation" category and select "New Members"
5. Finally click the "Save Changes" button.

Also, make sure you go through the list to remove all current spammers.
Just look through the messages, delete the author and the message.

Best regards,
Paul.

This looks like you need more lookahead, k=3 should do to distinguish 
"in" from "instanceof".
"in" : LA(1)=i, LA(2)=n, LA(3)=?
"instance" : LA(1)=i, LA(2)=n, LA(3)=s

Hello Oliver:

Look, If I put:

relational_op returns [JSToken rel_op]
{ rel_op = JSToken.None; }
        : LESS_THAN { rel_op = JSToken.LessThan; }
        | GREATER_THAN { rel_op = JSToken.GreaterThan; }
        | LESS_EQ { rel_op = JSToken.LessThanEqual; }
        | GREATER_EQ { rel_op = JSToken.GreaterThanEqual; }
        | "instanceof" { rel_op = JSToken.InstanceOf; }           <<<---
	| "in" { rel_op = JSToken.In; }   <<<----
        ;
 
I get the message: jscript.g:573:11:     k==1:"in"

Note that on my lexer options I already have: k = 3

If I erase that and add the lexical rule

IN: "in";

I get: 

jscript.g: warning:lexical nondeterminism between rules IDENTIFIER and
IN upon
jscript-lexer-parser.g:     k==1:'i'
jscript-lexer-parser.g:     k==2:'n'
jscript-lexer-parser.g:     k==3:<end-of-token>

The definition of IDENTIFIER  that I have is:

IDENTIFIER
options { testLiterals = true; }
        : ('a'..'z' | 'A'..'Z') ('a'..'z' | 'A'..'Z' | '0'..'9')*
        ;

what can I do?

Thanks a lot for the help.

Ah, I see now. This looks like a real nondeterminism. If you were really 
correct - I think nobody actually does this, this is just to make me 
point clear - you would have to omit the string "in" from your 
IDENTIFIER rule. Of course you should not do this, but simply put the IN 
rule before the IDENTIFIER which gives preceedence of IN over IDENTIFIER 
and ignore the warning.

You can try using syntactic predicate. I am not sure if that would be the correct way of 
doing it as i have just started using antlr.
  
...| ("instanceof") => "instanceof" { rel_op = JSToken.InstanceOf; }  
	| "in" { rel_op = JSToken.In; }

Why not simply adding to the lexer:

tokens {
   IN="in";
   INSTANCE_OF="instanceof";
};

or refering to "in" and "instanceof" in the parser?

This is what testLiterals is used for.

This is actually something that's better to left factor using a predicate
is expensive.

| "in" { rel_op = JSToken.In; } ("stanceof" { rel_op = JSToken.InstanceOf; } )?

This fixes things partially but "in" and "instanceof" will always be
ambiguous with the IDENTIFIER rule from a lexer point of view. It will
depend on context and the language wether it can be disambiguated at al.
Testing "in" and "instanceof" via the literals table in the IDENTIFIER rule
might give unwanted results too (is in/instanceof a valid identifier in
this language?).

Oliver might be right that this is one warning to live with (after
veryfying that antlr does the right thing)

Cheers,

Ric

Subject: [antlr-interest] much ado about nothing
Message-ID: <sfd70e16.055@prv-mail20.provo.novell.com>

So here are the differences between regular spam and spam on this list
as I see them:
 
- There must be a real e-mail address behind the spam on this list
since the new user must confirm the subscription request before
membership is granted.
- These lists can act as another level of indirection (filter) 
    -  can control who can send e-mail (public - anyone can post,
private - members only, or newsletter - only moderators/owners can
post)
    -  can moderate the membership and/or content directly.
 
The spam I get here at work is spoofed and they can create e-mail in
bulk using different fake "From:" addresses and servers as fast as the
computer can generate them and my junk-mail filter keeps growing as I
add more and more fake addresses/domains, most of which I probably won't
ever encounter again.  Since these lists require some level of active
enrollment, it is much more difficult to automate or spoof.
 
Also, your argument that "membership moderation is useless" is valid if
the spammer always chooses a name that is "normal".  The spammers on
this list that I can recall haven't ever used normal names.  Have you
actually removed someone like mybigstick@yahoo.com and had them come
back as john.smith@yahoo.com ?  Simple new member moderation would at
least take care of the obvious cases and *if they are reported* to
whatever service they are using (like yahoo.com), we can hopefully
damper stuff like this and prevent it from happening in the future.  
 
I guess I just don't like the idea of sitting back and letting it
happen because it is difficult to completely prevent and would rather do
something about it.  Let's try new member moderation, even for a short
time.  I believe it will help and I am even willing to volunteer my time
from the (GMT-7:00) Mountain Time Zone :-)=.
 
Jeff

>>> parrt@cs.usfca.edu 12/9/2003 12:51:29 PM >>>

Moderation on membership is useless as they will simply use john.smith

as a username and we'll be none the wiser.

Moderation on each message is very unsatisfactory as we'd need perhaps

3 moderators in perhaps 4 equidistant timezones to get decent response

time on each posting.

Do you really want to add that work load given how much spam you get in

your regular mailbox?  A trivial word filter on this list would be 
sufficient for all spam since you are not getting your regular personal

email in this folder.  You're going to add a big load to remove 2 or 3

spam a day?

I truly don't see how the antlr-list problem is different than your 
regular spam problem.

Hello Cristian!

dude! this solution rocked! thanks a lot. I get the nondeterminism
warning with this, but it's picking the correct rule at each case. So
I'll ignore that warning ;-)

By the way, I tried Oliver suggestion about IN taking precedence over
IDENTIFIER, it did work, but after that I could not recognize
identifiers that were having in as prefix: inverse;
			                   ^^

Thanks a lot for the suggestions guys, you rock!

Cesar--

Check the rules which call relational_op as well:  it's more likely that th=
e source of the (apparent) nondeterminism is there, but that 
the FOLLOW set is being evaluated within relational_op.  Sometimes the nond=
etermism warnings are due to the approximate LLk, but 
other times they indicate a problem and the warnings may tell you where the=
 nondeterminism was detected but not where it is 
caused.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Suggestion for simplifying a parser grammar
Message-ID: <br8g27+4igt@eGroups.com>

I've discovered a useful strategy for simplifying a parser grammar. 
In my application I need the lexer to make distinctions that are 
significant to the tree analysis but not to the parser.  That is, if 
the parser grammar were to make direct use of the token types from 
the lexer, it would need rules like:

id: (A|B|C|D|E|F)+;

I've found it convenient to simplify the parser grammar by using a 
filter to change some of the token types identified by the lexer.  
The previous rule now looks something like: 

id: (X)+;

The actual lexer token type is squirreled away in a sub-classed 
Token for use in the tree analysis.

(The documentation shipped with ANTLR discusses the necessary 
mechanisms for filtering a TokenStream and extending Token.)

Ok, let's try new member registration.  I have turned Monty and Loring 
into moderators in my zone in case I'm away from my desk or office.

May I suggest Oliver Zeigermann and Ric Klaren in European region?

Who can do it in Indian zones or Japan or China?  Preferably somebody 
we have seen post on the list so we know they are not spammers 
themselves! ;)  If anyone knows geography better than I do, please 
suggest some other locations ;)

I'll try to do all the moderation, but as backups it would be nice to 
have others.

The status of the list now shows:

   Membership Type :  Restricted (you approve all requests for 
membership)

Thanks to everyone for their input.  I consider you folks my 
"customers" and so, hearing no objections, I am going to moderate list 
membership.

Now I have to go undelete the spam and find the addresses of the 
abusers ;)

Best regards,

Ok, let's try new member registration.  I have turned Monty and Loring 
into moderators in my zone in case I'm away from my desk or office.

May I suggest Oliver Zeigermann and Ric Klaren in European region?

Who can do it in Indian zones or Japan or China?  Preferably somebody 
we have seen post on the list so we know they are not spammers 
themselves! ;)  If anyone knows geography better than I do, please 
suggest some other locations ;)

The status of the list now shows:

   Membership Type :  Restricted (you approve all requests for 
membership)

Thanks to everyone for their input.  I consider you folks my 
"customers" and so, hearing no objections, I am going to moderate list 
membership.

Now I have to go undelete the spam and find the addresses of the 
abusers ;)

Best regards,
Terence

You have still not turned the moderation of post from new
members feature on.

Huh?  I set it to moderate new members and only members can post...what 
else do I need to do?

We will not be moderating actual posts.  You have caused so much 
traffic on this list; like 10x the spam we get.  You are worse than 
spam, dude.

Is ok. Although I don't completely see the need with the amount of spam
getting through, I don't understand why yahoogroups does not ditch the lot
in an ip block. But let's not restart the discussion ;)

In order not to stand back behind Ric ;) I would volunteer to be his 
backup. I guess it is only about checking new users, right?

I'm located in Iceland (timezone GMT, no summer savings), and I can
offer to be a backup-moderator, if one is needed.

I haven't posted here alot, but the offer stands.

Define it as a rule in the lexer I guess and tell antlr's lexer to skip it
with $setType (as described in the lexer docs)

Subject: [antlr-interest] New Snapshot MSVC 6/7.0/7.1 users please test
Message-ID: <20031211173955.C23650@cs.utwente.nl>

Hi,

I started moving stuff around for MSVC 6-7.1. Included a load of stuff from
a big patch from Tom Dudziak (thanks! and of course to all the others who
sent in stuff for MSVC!)

The load of explicit instantiations for templates was moved dll.cpp. This
will probably cause some problems with VC7 due to some changes probably in
the codebase and because I may have goofed it up or misunderstood some
stuff about MSVC.

Again I don't have these compilers so please bear with me... These changes
will be a prelude to ANTLR 2.7.3 prereleases just before christmas (if all
goes well).

I hope that currently:

- MSVC 6 static build should work out of the box. DLL Build was disabled
  with #error statements. It will work with STL port (I'm told) but I wanted
  that very explicit so people have to junks a few lines to get it running.
- MSVC 7/7.1 will probably work out of the box for static build
- For DLL builds 7.0 might need some tweaking for explicit instantiations
  some small stuff changed requiring other instantiations.
- For 7.1 it might work directly as well.

When giving patches please be very specific about what compiler you used.
And guard everything with your compiler version (for as far as it makes
sense of course).

#if ( _MSC_VER < 1300 )  >>>> vc6 and before
#if ( _MSC_VER == 1300 ) >>>> vc7
#if ( _MSC_VER == 1310 ) >>>> vc7.1

I prefer keeping the source as #ifdef free as possible, especially I would
rather not see _MSC_VER's all over the place if it can be helped.

When stuff stabilizes I'd much appreciate some workspaces for the contrib
section. (Thanks for the ones already sent in but since I cannot test them
I'd rather hold of including them as long as possible)

The snapshot can be found at:

http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr/
http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr/antlr-20031211.tar.gz

Cheer,

Ric

PS It also has all the latests C# stuff from the repository.
PPS I also suspect the configure to give less trouble on Cygwin.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Help on syntactic predicate
Message-ID: <brbeo2+nac2@eGroups.com>

Hi all

I just started on learning ANTLR, and ran into a problem with the use 
of syntactic predicate. The .g file below defines just a few tokens : 
WORD(string of alphabets) and NUMBER(string of digits). I tried to 
declare a new token called ALPHANUM, which is defined to be some 
alphabets followed by some digits.

//Lexer

WORD	: ((ALPHABET)+) => (ALPHABET)+ (DIGIT)+ {$setType(ALPHANUM);}
	| (ALPHABET)+
	;

//Parser
alphanum: (an:ALPHANUM { cout << "<alphanum>" << an->getText().c_str
() << "</alphanum>\n"; })
	;

The .g file compiles without a warning but when I run it, it crashes 
with a debug warning "This application has requested the Runtime to 
terminate it in a unusual way." This only happened after I added the 
above code segments to the grammer file. Is there anything wrong in 
the way I wrote my code? Thanks!

Full grammer file :
------------------------------------------------------------------
header {
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

}

options {
	language="Cpp";
}

class SelfParser extends Parser;
options {
	genHashLines = true;		// include line number 
information
	k=2;
}

sentence:	{cout << "<sentence>\n";}
			(word|number)+ FULLSTOP
			{cout << "</sentence>\n";}
	;

alphanum: (an:ALPHANUM { cout << "<alphanum>" << an->getText().c_str
() << "</alphanum>\n"; })
	;

word:		(w:WORD { cout << "<word>" << w->getText().c_str() 
<< "</word>\n"; })
	;
	
number:		(n:NUMBER { cout << "<number>" << n->getText().c_str
() << "</number>\n"; })
	;

class SelfLexer extends Lexer;
options {
	k=3;
	charVocabulary='\u0000'..'\u007F'; //allow ascii
}


WORD		: ((ALPHABET)+) => (ALPHABET)+ (DIGIT)+ {$setType
(ALPHANUM);}
			| (ALPHABET)+
			;



NUMBER		: (DIGIT)+					
	;
FULLSTOP	: '.'						
	;

protected
ALPHABET	: ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z')			;

Kevin--

Add a "tokens" section to the lexer which defines ALPHANUM as a 
valid token type.  That should help.

Hi Loring

Do you mean adding the lines

tokens {
ALPHANUM;
}

to the lexer just after "options"? This doesn't work.

Hmm.  That should have worked.  The alternative way to do the same 
thing is to add a

protected
ALPHANUM : ;

definition to the lexer.

This would probably perform better in this case:

WORD : (ALPHABET)+ {$setType(WORD);} ( (DIGIT)+ {$setType(ALPHANUM);} )? ;

This kind of predicate introduces backtracking e.g. first the expression
before the => is tried and then redone if the test succeeded.

That aside the predicate does not make much sense since it won't
disambiguate the alternatives. I would more expect something like:

WORD : ( (ALPHABET)+ DIGIT ) => (ALPHABET)+ (DIGIT)+ {$setType(ALPHANUM);}
     | (ALPHABET)+ 
     ;

E.g. look for letter sequence followed by a digit if so select first
alternative else ...

Things like ANTLR version and used compiler could be handy...

Looking at the code generated (with latests snapshot) I don't see anything
funny. A backtrace of the crash would be helpfull. (You did run it in a
debugger to see where it crashes?)

I am getting a nondeterminism warning with a parser:

I think "class" and "interface" should be able to distinguish

I am wrong? I'd appreciate any help.

This is the prediction code for rule definition:

if ((LA(1)==LITERAL_class||LA(1)==LITERAL_local) &&
(LA(2)==LITERAL_class||LA(2)==IDENTIFIER)) {
  class_decl_or_def();
} else if ((LA(1)==LITERAL_interface||LA(1)==LITERAL_local) &&
(LA(2)==IDENTIFIER||LA(2)==LITERAL_interface)) {
  interface_decl_or_def();
}

This actually corresponds to the above warning. It seems to me you are
a victim of approximated LL lookahead :( 

Or am I wrong? Experts?

Correct. The grammar is strong LL(2), confirmed by the SLK parser-
generator (http://parsers.org).

Ahh....the mysterious human behind SLK awakens.  Welcome to the group. 
:)

Care to share with us how your lookahead computation algorithms work?  
The reason I ask is that I'm confused by your statement on your site:

> ... SLK does a complete strong LL(k) analysis of the grammar. The SLK 
> algorithm is the only currently known near-solution to this

Part of my confusion is that SLL(k) subset LALL(k) subset LL(k).  I 
cite pg 233 of "Parsing Theory II" by Sippu and Soisalon-soininen, 
Spring-Verlag 1990: "For k>1, the class of SLL(k) grammars is properly 
contained in the class of LALL(k) grammars...".  PCCTS did/does LALL(k) 
and thus can generate a larger class of languages than SLK.  Can you 
clear up my misunderstanding?

But for what maximum value of k, and in what time?

Why the nondeterminism in the grammar that is strong LL(2)?

That's not my question.  Your claim contradicts well-established 
parsing theory...how do you respond?

> Why the nondeterminism in the grammar that is strong LL(2)?

Because antlr 2 only does approximate LALL(k) not full LALL(k), but 
PCCTS (antlr 1) did full LALL(k) and antlr 3 (coming soon to a theatre 
near you) will do that plus LL-regular.

Your SLK is weaker than PCCTS's LALL(k)...just wanted to clear that up. 
  You make some dubious claims on your site and I find your anonymity 
highly curious.

Terence

I guess this is a misunderstanding, Sarah does not claim LALL(k) is a 
subset of SLL(k), but SLK's algorithm is the only that does practical 
SLL(k) near computation. ANTLR does approximate LALL(k), so SLK subset 
ANTLR is not true.

I did not see any evidence Sarah denies this. She simply says for larger 
  k PCCTS's (non-approximate) LALL(k) algorithm is impractical, which is 
true, isn't it?

Subject: [antlr-interest] Need help with EOL mess
Message-ID: <brknvv+su96@eGroups.com>

I am writing a PostScript interpreter based upon antlr. I am having 
problems matching the correct end-of-line sequence. I would like to 
match CR-LF on those files that contain this sequence, but 
PostScript mandates all three EOL sequences are supported.

Normally this would be a trivial problem - who cares if I matched a 
CR and then a LF if it is all being ignored by an interpreter? 
However I need this for two reasons. The first is that I would like 
an accurate line count for debugging purposes. The second is that 
PostScript allows user programs to read from the current file, 
essentially bypassing the interpreter. (This is how image data is 
embedded into PostScript programs).

This issue I have is that the operator that reads from the current 
file (named "image") expects the data to be present immediately 
after the operator. For example, an image where four bytes of data 
are expected:

image<CR>1234 nextoperator

seems to work but

image<CR><LF>1234 nextoperator

does not. The data should begin with the "1" but in the second 
example it seems to begin with the LF because the scanner has 
matched the CR and not the CR-LF pair. 

Here is my whitespace definition from the grammar file:

WHITESPACE
    // This rule matches and discards any whitespace.
    : ( ' '
      | '\t'
      | ( options { generateAmbigWarnings=false; }
          : "\r\n"          { newline(); }      // Microsoft
          | '\r'            { newline(); }      // Macintosh
          | '\n'            { newline(); }      // Unix
        )
      )+  { $setType(Token.SKIP); }
    ;

This *does* generate ambiguous warnings but I don't know how to 
address this. Does anyone have any suggestions?

Regards,

   Steve

Hi Oliver,

Actually "Sarah" does indeed claim SLK is more powerful than any other 
LL(k) subset:

"All other practical LL(k) analysis algorithms work on  language 
classes that are proper subsets of the strong LL(k) languages. "

I think you'll find that LALL(k) done by PCCTS is a proper *superset*.  
I don't understand "only one that does practical SLL(k) near 
computation".  Can you rephrase?  Again, PCCTS does full LALL(k); my 
dissertation was how approximate lookahead can be used to attenuate the 
complexity of computation and storage of lookahead.  This includes 
weaker parser as well as helping to build full LALL(k) parsers.

Let's see if I can come up with an example that PCCTS will accept, but 
is not SLL(k).  Ok, this grammar is LALL(1) and even approximate 
LALL(1), meaning even ANTLR 2 will handle it no sweat.  A Strong LL(k) 
analysis should find a nondeterminism upon A in rule s's subrule for 
ANY value of k.  The problem is in the accuracy of lookahead not the 
depth.

s : Z (a | ) B ;

a : A;

t : X a A ;

The (a | ) subrule in s needs to see the "local FOLLOW" as B not {A,B} 
which is the "global FOLLOW" seen by a Strong LL(k) analysis.  Here is 
the correct prediction for the subrule generated by ANTLR 2.7.2:

                         switch ( LA(1)) {
                         case A:
                         {
                                 a();
                                 break;
                         }
                         case B:
                         {
                                 break;
                         }

Duplicating rule a will make this LALL(1) grammar SLL(1) and 
demonstrates part of the reason LL(k) is exponentially complex in terms 
of just the parser size (not including lookahead).

Please correct me if SLL(k) will handle this; I'll go back to the books 
and start reading again ;)  It *has* been a while since I did formal 
language stuff ;)

The complexity of any parser (LR or LL based) is exponential in k just 
to hold a single lookahead set so only a constant improvement can be 
done.  That said, the constant can make quite a difference!  I applaud 
their efforts if they have made this very fast.  I'd like to hear about 
it, but get stonewalled all the time.  I don't like bogus claims and I 
don't like people who won't reveal who they are.

Sorry if I seem grouchy...this human was a real "pleasure" over private 
email when I thanked them for referencing my work and sincerely asked 
to discuss their algorithms.

[I apologize for any unnecessary irritability; damn cold virus and a 
million other things going on this week.]

recommend running it through a debugger to see what is happening, or using
the -traceLexer option to antlr.Tool and diagnosing it that way.

If you can't find the problem then we'll need a small complete grammar with
test input to try out for ourselves to help you further.

On a tangent, how do you know the length of the binary data for the image?
Or is it not binary?  Anyhow, how do you know when it ends?

Yes, this is a linear approximation issue.  Use a syntactic predicate in
definition to choose between the two options.

This is the prediction code for rule definition:

if ((LA(1)==LITERAL_class||LA(1)==LITERAL_local) &&
(LA(2)==LITERAL_class||LA(2)==IDENTIFIER)) {
  class_decl_or_def();
} else if ((LA(1)==LITERAL_interface||LA(1)==LITERAL_local) &&
(LA(2)==IDENTIFIER||LA(2)==LITERAL_interface)) {
  interface_decl_or_def();
}

This actually corresponds to the above warning. It seems to me you are
a victim of approximated LL lookahead :( 

Or am I wrong? Experts?

For me it boils down to what is the relation of approximate LALL(k) and

the other way round. Can someone clarify for me, please?

There is an ambiguity because of the newline() action. "\r\n" can be 
interpreted as either
  "\r\n" { newline(); } or
  '\r' { newline(); } '\n' { newline(); }

I think that either phrasing newline whitespace as
  ('\r')? '\n { newline(); }
  | '\r' { newline(); }

or setting the greedy option to "true" (preferred) works.

I seemed to have better luck by removing the CR-LF pair and just 
dealing with CCR or LF. (I am betting is that I can correctly 
postprocess a sequence of CR & LF characters to figure out the 
appropriate line number). However, after my image operator is done, 
antlr reports finding a CR, CR, and LF sequence. There is only one 
CR-LF sequence in the PS file - do I need to clear out the lookahead 
characters?  And if so, what is the right way to do this?

On the tangent, PostScript has reverse Polish notation. All operands 
are manipulated through an operand stack. The image width, height, 
bits/sample, color components, etc., should all precede the image 
operator and sit on the operand stack. Then the trick is to keep 
reading from the appropriate data source (the current file) until 
enough data has been accumulated.

Hi !!
My rule in lexer -

ignores $Role in a file and doesn't pass it to parser.but it seems it does

Also, I am not clear what happens if my file doesn't contain this $Role word
i.e I want this rule to execute if there is a $Role word in the file else
skip this rule.How can I achieve this??

Subject: [antlr-interest] Epsilon productions and end of file
Message-ID: <003201c3c3a9$63e77b70$95a886d5@rzeznik>

Hi. How should I specify epsilon productions in my grammar? So far I've been
using following pattern:

    production: other_prodution | ();

But it doesn't seem to work. Theory says that end-of-input char (usually
marked as $) is a member of starting production's follow set. Therefore,
supposing we have grammar:

    S -> AS`
    S`-> aS | "epsilon"

we should end up with $ in follow set of S`, which will result in placing
production:

     S`->"epsilon"

in parsing table, to be chosen by parser when it reads EOF from input
stream. But my parser, generated by ANTLR for Java, do not respect this and
throws exception when meeting EOF. After inspection of its source code I
have discovered that it has not placed EOF condition in its switch
instructions. I do not suppose this a bug (if it was so, it would be
horrible), I'd rather say I had not specified my intention clearly and
parser did not discover it as "epsilon" production.

Hi Terence,

You've seen this one ?

Thomas a question: where do you have these token sections? lexer or parser?
Parser and lexer in one file or multiple, token section with the lexer or
with the parser ? A small example grammar would be practical.

Don't think I will fix it for 2.7.3 in C++ mode it touches too many icky
parts. (Although in C++ mode it's probably something else going wrong as in
Java mode)

How about a simple include mechanism instead of inheritance.
That's in essence what the current inheritance mechanism does.

A simple include directive allows you to include common 
grammar rules. That would solve most of my problems
(especially if it also works for class methods).

It would also be nice if it were possible to extend previously 
defined grammar rules, i.e. adding additional subrules.

For example:

    statement    :   "ASSIGN" | "MOVE" ;
    statement + : "LET" | "GOTO" ;

That way it would be possible to define common grammar parts
in include files, and extend these grammar rules in a specific 
parser.

 Seems to me it's confusing "\r\n" and '\r' (which would make sense).

Can you combine these two rules as "'\r' ('\n')?"?

Cheers,

Here is my whitespace definition from the grammar file:

WHITESPACE
    // This rule matches and discards any whitespace.
    : ( ' '
      | '\t'
      | ( options { generateAmbigWarnings=false; }
          : "\r\n"          { newline(); }      // Microsoft

          | '\n'            { newline(); }      // Unix
        )
      )+  { $setType(Token.SKIP); }
    ;

This *does* generate ambiguous warnings but I don't know how to 
address this. Does anyone have any suggestions?

This incomplete grammar is LL(1). If you add a production like 

s : t;

it is still LL(1).

Subject: [antlr-interest] Epsilon productions and end of file
Message-ID: <sfdf624a.088@emil.oddi.is>

Hello,

I think ANTLR (as most parser generators) doesn't automatically assume
that end-of-file is reached after the start symbol. In fact, ANTLR
doesn't know which rule is the start-rule, because it's called at
run-time from your main-routine (or whatever). This allows you to parse
f.x. file headers and leave the file pointer after the parsable portion
and possibile continue reading some more data from there.

This means that you must specifically tell ANTLR where to expect
end-of-file, and for that you use the special token EOF.

As for epsilon-productions, you would use the ? operator. In you
example,

production: ( other_production )? ;

Hope this helps,
Arnar

>>> marcin-rzeznicki@wp.pl 12/16/03 7:51 AM >>>
Hi. How should I specify epsilon productions in my grammar? So far I've
been
using following pattern:

    production: other_prodution | ();

But it doesn't seem to work. Theory says that end-of-input char (usually
marked as $) is a member of starting production's follow set. Therefore,
supposing we have grammar:

    S -> AS`
    S`-> aS | "epsilon"

we should end up with $ in follow set of S`, which will result in
placing
production:

     S`->"epsilon"

in parsing table, to be chosen by parser when it reads EOF from input
stream. But my parser, generated by ANTLR for Java, do not respect this
and
throws exception when meeting EOF. After inspection of its source code I
have discovered that it has not placed EOF condition in its switch
instructions. I do not suppose this a bug (if it was so, it would be
horrible), I'd rather say I had not specified my intention clearly and
parser did not discover it as "epsilon" production.

Thanks Ric,

I'd posted Terence personally a few days later but didn't have any examples
to hand. Well, thanks for bringing those code snippets.

Here's the JDOQL grammar which should demonstrate these. I've got a few
versions but hopefully this one will produce the result we've seen. The
Semantic treeparser is for completeness, but probably not needed to
demonstrate the error.

Yes, but when I use explicit EOF, it does not calculate follow sets as I
would expect. For example

S -> AB , means taht follow set of S goes to follow set of B (with $)

S -> AB EOF ends with EOF in follow set of S, nothing to do with B

Isn't taht valid only for regular languages ? Does that hold with
context-free ones ?

Subject: [antlr-interest] Positioning input stream (was EOL sequence)
Message-ID: <broo3c+3gic@eGroups.com>

I have worked out enough details with the EOL sequences to 
understand where my PostScript parser is failing. PostScript parsers 
have to be able to handle the following four example sequences 
identically:

currentfile read 3
currentfile read<CR>3
currentfile read<LF>3
currentfile read<CR><LF>3

where the "currentfile read" operator sequence instructs the 
PostScript interpreter to read one byte from the input stream.

There is no issue with the first three examples. The input stream 
point just past the EOL byte once the "read" operator has been 
recognized. Then the read operator simply has to pull one byte from 
the input stream (a FileInputStream in this case).

However, in the fourth case, the input stream points to the <LF> 
character when the "read" operator has been recognized. The 
PostScript spec states that "Any of the three forms of EOL ... is 
treated as a single white-space character."

How do I handle this? What can or should I do in the lexer versus in 
the parser?

Regards,

   Steve

I'm sorry, I don't quite follow. S -> AB EOF should not result in EOF
being in FOLLOW(S), but in FOLLOW(B).

I'm not even sure how ANTLR parsers, being recursive-descent parsers,
use the follow set. Anyone?

ANTLR uses regular-like syntax to express certain constructs in LL(k)
languages (which are context-free). Please see the ANTLR manual at
www.antlr.org for reference.

Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLR FOR PARSING JSP PAGES
Message-ID: <brq1iv+n8m9@eGroups.com>

Hello guys!
I dont know the head and tail of ANTLR. But i came to know that we 
can write custom parsers using antlr.

At my work, we are internationalizing our project. This involves 
1000s of JSP pages which have static text as well as dynamic content.
In the process of internationalization, we would like to move all 
the static and dynamic content to resource bundles (resouce bundle 
is a .properties file with key-value pairs. eg. the file name can be 
product1_en_US.properties or product1_ja_JP.properties the key-value 
pair example can be product.name=bose  or page.title=product page or 
something like that)

As a developer i would like to automate this process  so that if we 
provide any jsp page it will generate name_en_US.properties file with
key-value pairs as specified above. 

I see two issues here ,  give a jsp page  it has to determine what 
is the content and what is tag or meta-information (<HTML> <A 
href= ..) and secondly it has to generate key so that it makes sense 
as for that value as described above.


If you can throw light on how I can use antlr so develop such a 
parser, that would be a great boost for me.

I appreciate your help.

Thank you
regards
Madhu Tera

Subject: [antlr-interest] Automatic semicolon insertion
Message-ID: <brq1r9+c87g@eGroups.com>

Hi,
I'm writing a parser for JavaScript but I've encountered a major 
stumbling block with the concept of 'automatic semicolon insertion' -
 in short, that statements need not be terminated by semicolons 
before an RBRACE or after an newline.
Initially, to get around warning messages, it was implemented as a 
Token filter on the input to the parser but to cover all commmon 
eventualities, this is not possible as it requires the full grammar 
context. In the grammar, where I used to have a rule:

semicolon: SEMICOLON;

I replaced this with:

auto_semicolon:
	(SEMICOLON
          { LA(1) == RBRACE || LT(1).getLine() != lastTokenLine }? 
	)
	;
This does appear to work but Antlr generates lots of nondeterminism 
warnings that I cannot seem to turn off with any of the options. 
Firstly, is this the only approach I can take? And how can I 
determine whether my grammar parses correctly given these warnings? 
Are there any resources that deal with this kind of ambiguity?

Here is a small subset of the gramar:

    primary_expression:
        IDENTIFIER 
        | literal 
        | LPAREN expression RPAREN
        ;

   
    arguments:
        LPAREN  (argument_list)? RPAREN
       ;

    argument_list:

    ;

    
expression_statement:    
       expression auto_semicolon
    ;     

	
empty_statement :
    SEMICOLON;

Problem statements are:
// Here y is assumed to be a function call and the z assignment 
// becomes a second statement i.e. x = y(a+b); z = q;
x = y
(a + b)
z = q;
// Here we have an assignment and an addition expression
x = y;
(a + b );


The default (greedy) nature of the generated parser seems to ensure 
that both of the above statements are parsed correctly though there 
is an ambigutiy between the rules for 'arguments' 
and 'primary_expression'.  I'd be very grateful for any help people 
can shine on this.

Many thanks,

Henry

i don't know too much about ps syntax, but you could simply make your whitespace rule consume spaces as well as newlines in your lexer.  the java example that comes with antlr does this.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Positioning input stream (was EOL sequence)


I have worked out enough details with the EOL sequences to 
understand where my PostScript parser is failing. PostScript parsers 
have to be able to handle the following four example sequences 
identically:

currentfile read 3
currentfile read<CR>3
currentfile read<LF>3
currentfile read<CR><LF>3

where the "currentfile read" operator sequence instructs the 
PostScript interpreter to read one byte from the input stream.

There is no issue with the first three examples. The input stream 
point just past the EOL byte once the "read" operator has been 
recognized. Then the read operator simply has to pull one byte from 
the input stream (a FileInputStream in this case).

However, in the fourth case, the input stream points to the <LF> 
character when the "read" operator has been recognized. The 
PostScript spec states that "Any of the three forms of EOL ... is 
treated as a single white-space character."

How do I handle this? What can or should I do in the lexer versus in 
the parser?

Regards,

   Steve

My apologies for the typo - this should have read:
auto_semicolon:
(SEMICOLON

)
;

Note empty second option.

Steve, 
	Would you be able to reproduce your problem in a short .g file and
some sample input?  Most every parser I know handles the CR LF problem fine,
including the java.g parser in the examples directory or my GCC parser
http://www.codetransform.com/gcc.html.  I think you are doing something
obviously wrong but that "obviously" part isn't in your messages.

ANTLR is usually not too happy about predicates that predict matching
nothing.  Inspecting the generated code should convince you of whether it
will work right or not.  I don't think you'll be able to get rid of the
warnings.

Actually, how about inverting?

auto_semicolon:
  ( {!(LA(1) == RBRACE || LT(1).getLine() != lastTokenLine) }? SEMICOLON
    | /*epsilon*/
  )
;
You may get a message about a superfluous alternative, that can be ignored.

Let us know.

I suppose you are talking about XPA's parser, right? It has quite some 
limitations among them the ones named by you. Just use any SAX parser 
you like and you should be ok :)

XPA is for Java only, that's right. Again, it seems you mistake XPA for 
its integrated parser. This parser is only a part of XPA. This parser 
could be ported to C++ with little effort, that's right. Porting XPA to 
C++ is somewhat harder. I am not shure if it is worth it. I would 
propose to use a simple C++ SAX or DOM parser instead of XPA. XPA is 
especially suited for *complicated* transformations or imports.

Thanks for the interest and cheers :)

Henry--

I can think of a couple of refactorings that might help.  First, move semicolon out of statement so that

(statement)* becomes ( (statement semicolon) | block )

Then change semicolon to

semicolon
     :
     { newline_test() }?
     |     SEMICOLON
     ;

and define an appropriate newline_test().

You'll then have to do some more work to let block handle the optional semicolon for the last statement.

Of course, I have misplaced symbols. It should be: EOF goes to FOLLOW(B),
but FOLLOW(S) is not in FOLLOW(B) anymore. I am sorry. What I mean is that
by writing S->AB I expect FOLLOW(S) to be in FOLLOW(B), as FOLLOW(S)
contains EOF, so does FOLLOW(B). By writing S->AB EOF it ends up in EOF
being in FOLLOW(B), but without everything else from FOLLOW(S). In my
example the grammar is like:
F->DF'
D->...
P->(F) | ...
Constructing LL parser with pencil I have assumed that ')' is in FOLLOW(F),
therefore in FOLLOW(F'), and every word of generated lanuage may be
terminated by ')' or EOF. But parser did not want to choose epsilon
productions that should occur when EOF was read, but tried to look ahead for
another token, which resulted in throwing an exception. So it only accepted
words terminating with ')'

When I transformed grammar to:
F->DF' EOF
....
P->(F)|...
FOLLOW (F) contains ')' as well as EOF, but then FOLLOW(F') does not contain
')', so parser does not accept words that have ')' somewhere within.

That's my problem.

I had a thought.  Have you set k to 2 or higher in your lexer?  If it's 1, that would cause problems.

Message-ID: <brr592+10fp7@eGroups.com>

Thanks for all the replies to date. Terence, I did look at your 
parser, which was a partial PostScript parser, but I am currently 
far past your example. I am using "k=2" for the lexer. I have 
cleaned up some of the ambiguity warnings - thanks to many people.

I have no problem consuming whitespace when I am *parsing* or 
*lexing*. The problem arises with PostScript's read operators, which 
permit interruption of the parsing process to read arbitrary data 
from the current input stream. 

PostScript has almost no productions. Once a token is recognized, it 
is immediately executed by the parser. The parser does not have to 
match against any sequence of tokens - all tokens are standalone. In 
this example, 

currentfile read<LF>X<LF>

"currentfile" is recognized as a name token, passed to the parser, 
and is immediately executed by the parser. Then "read" is recognized 
as a name token, passed to the parser and immediately executed. Now 
the read operator pulls one byte from the input stream, in this case 
the "X" byte from the input stream. For a EOL sequence of LF or CR, 
this sequence executes as expected - the next read from the input 
stream does indeed return the "X" byte. However, when I return from 
executing the read operator, two whitespace sequences are recognized 
by the lexer, a LF and another LF. I expected one since the input 
stream should now be positioned past the X - but why is there 
another? Do I need to clear out the lookahead buffer, and if so, how 
do I do this? 

For PostScript, standalone white space is tossed out, so this 
particular sequence is not a big problem unless I want an accurate 
line number. But the following sequence is a problem.

currentfile read<CR><LF>X<CR><LF>

Here the read operator picks up the <LF> instead of the X. When I 
return from executing the read operator, the lexer recognizes a CR 
and the "X" character. Since "X" is not a valid PostScript name 
operator (semantics not syntax), the interpretation fails. 
PostScript expects the read operator to obtain the "X" character and 
the next whitespace sequence to be the final CR-LF. 

It seems like I need advance warning that a CR-LF sequence is coming 
before a name operator like "read" is executed. But the next token 
has not yet been requested by the parser.

Any thoughts on how to get out of this?

   Regards,

      Steve

Hello,

Sorry i have not been following every post because of christmas, but to 
force the right match have you tried something like this in the lexer:

EOL : ({ LA(1) == '\r' && LA(2) == '\n' }?    "\r\n"
		| '\r'
		| '\n')
	;
	

Because you are reading your own input file the solution might be more 
complicated if your input is unlexable by your postscript lexer.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Positioning input stream (was EOL sequence)

I have worked out enough details with the EOL sequences to 
understand where my PostScript parser is failing. PostScript parsers 
have to be able to handle the following four example sequences 
identically:

currentfile read 3
currentfile read<CR>3
currentfile read<LF>3
currentfile read<CR><LF>3

where the "currentfile read" operator sequence instructs the 
PostScript interpreter to read one byte from the input stream.

There is no issue with the first three examples. The input stream 
point just past the EOL byte once the "read" operator has been 
recognized. Then the read operator simply has to pull one byte from 
the input stream (a FileInputStream in this case).

However, in the fourth case, the input stream points to the <LF> 
character when the "read" operator has been recognized. The 
PostScript spec states that "Any of the three forms of EOL ... is 
treated as a single white-space character."

How do I handle this? What can or should I do in the lexer versus in 
the parser?

Regards,

   Steve

Subject: [antlr-interest] Problem with lexer rule
Message-ID: <brrugh+10a8@eGroups.com>

Hello,

I'm just using antlr for step physical files and am pretty impressed
by the tool. I have a little problem to distinguish string like
'abcd.'


STRING : 
       APOSTROPHE! ( SPECIAL | DIGIT | SPACE | LOWER | UPPER  | "''" 
| REVERSE_SOLIDUS  )* APOSTROPHE!
       {Part21File.lexerLog.debug("found a string " + getText());} ;

and enumerations like '.UNUSED.'

ENUMERATION 
    options { paraphrase="an enumeration";} :
     '.'! UPPER ((UPPER | DIGIT )*) '.'!
     {Part21File.lexerLog.debug("found an enumeration " +
getText());} ;

How could I tell the string rule that tokens starting and ending with
a point (member of special) and including only uppercase and digits
are enumerations ?

Thanks, Carsten

Hello Marcin,

Could you post a portion of your ANTLR grammar?

Btw: Are you eliminating left-recursion by adding F'? If so it's
convenient to use ANTLR-specific syntax instead (the ? or + operators).

For the case of k=1, all top-down grammars are equivalent. That is

    LL(1) == SLL(1) == LALL(1)

Only for the case of k>1 does the left context become a factor in the 
strength of the grammar. The difference is subtle, and always depends 
on the lookahead strings. Approximate lookahead has no knowledge of 
strings, only token sets at each k-level. So the distinction between 
LL, LALL, and SLL is meaningless and

    LL'(k) == SLL'(k) == LALL'(k) 

and these are all very small subsets of any of the classical LL 
grammars, including SLL(k).

Put another way, if you convert an exponential number of lookaheads 
to a linear one, would you not expect to lose considerable 
recognition power?

Go back to the original grammar of this thread. It was SLL(2) by 
inspection, yet approximate lookahead could not handle it.

Could you explain why this is the case? Maybe it is obvious, but I do
not see why LALL'(k) subset SLL(k)...

Of course, but this only is an argument for LL'(k) subset LL(k), isn't it?

I got that, but this does not prove LALL'(k) subset SLL(k). It only
proves SLL(k) not subset LALL'(k), but not the other way round.

Anyway, thanks for taking it this far! I really appreciate that :)

Subject: [antlr-interest] Problem with lexer rule

Hello,

I'm just using antlr for step physical files and am pretty impressed
by the tool. I have a little problem to distinguish string like
'abcd.'


STRING : 
       APOSTROPHE! ( SPECIAL | DIGIT | SPACE | LOWER | UPPER  | "''" 
| REVERSE_SOLIDUS  )* APOSTROPHE!
       {Part21File.lexerLog.debug("found a string " + getText());} ;

and enumerations like '.UNUSED.'

ENUMERATION 
    options { paraphrase="an enumeration";} :
     '.'! UPPER ((UPPER | DIGIT )*) '.'!
     {Part21File.lexerLog.debug("found an enumeration " +
getText());} ;

How could I tell the string rule that tokens starting and ending with
a point (member of special) and including only uppercase and digits
are enumerations ?

Thanks, Carsten

Yes, you do need to reset the lookahead buffer.  Doing your read from the
parser is a bad idea in general.  If you are strictly k=1 in your parser and
don't use any syntactic predicates then you may be able to do it reliably,
but I would strongly recommend doing it in the lexer.  ANTLR lexers are
powerful enough to actually be parsers in their own right.

Not being familiar with PostScript I'm not sure how practical that is.  For
this one rule you could use lexer states.  But wait, does the interpreter
use information on the stack for how many bytes to read?  

If so, you may be better off maintaining your stack in the lexer.  

The core of the problem is that the parser needs k tokens ahead of the
current match to be able to predict what to match next.  That "k" is at
least what you say k is, but with a syntactic predicate k is unbounded.  So
in the extreme case you may have already lexed the entire input stream
before you even start parsing.  The lookahead buffer is filled as needed, so
it doesn't always have k elements in it.

What is really happening below is that the lexer, which also has a lookahead
buffer, has already read the 'CR' and has it in its lookahead buffer.  It
has not lexed the whitespace yet.  The input stream has not read the LF yet.
Luckily for you, in this particular production the parser didn't need to
know LA(1) yet.  If it needed that then the whitespace would have been lexed
and skipped and then X would have been lexed, turned into a Token and put
into the parser's lookahead buffer.  The lexer would have read the following
LF to know to end lexing X and the input stream would be set at the
following CR.

Solution?  Do it in the lexer and switch lexer states when you know you're
going to read a fixed amount of data.  And before switching call the WS rule
to read all of the whitespace before the data.  I believe there is a note on
the antlr website or FAQ or manual about reading fixed length records for
more details.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Re: Positioning input stream (was EOL sequence)

Thanks for all the replies to date. Terence, I did look at your 
parser, which was a partial PostScript parser, but I am currently 
far past your example. I am using "k=2" for the lexer. I have 
cleaned up some of the ambiguity warnings - thanks to many people.

I have no problem consuming whitespace when I am *parsing* or 
*lexing*. The problem arises with PostScript's read operators, which 
permit interruption of the parsing process to read arbitrary data 
from the current input stream. 

PostScript has almost no productions. Once a token is recognized, it 
is immediately executed by the parser. The parser does not have to 
match against any sequence of tokens - all tokens are standalone. In 
this example, 

currentfile read<LF>X<LF>

"currentfile" is recognized as a name token, passed to the parser, 
and is immediately executed by the parser. Then "read" is recognized 
as a name token, passed to the parser and immediately executed. Now 
the read operator pulls one byte from the input stream, in this case 
the "X" byte from the input stream. For a EOL sequence of LF or CR, 
this sequence executes as expected - the next read from the input 
stream does indeed return the "X" byte. However, when I return from 
executing the read operator, two whitespace sequences are recognized 
by the lexer, a LF and another LF. I expected one since the input 
stream should now be positioned past the X - but why is there 
another? Do I need to clear out the lookahead buffer, and if so, how 
do I do this? 

For PostScript, standalone white space is tossed out, so this 
particular sequence is not a big problem unless I want an accurate 
line number. But the following sequence is a problem.

currentfile read<CR><LF>X<CR><LF>

Here the read operator picks up the <LF> instead of the X. When I 
return from executing the read operator, the lexer recognizes a CR 
and the "X" character. Since "X" is not a valid PostScript name 
operator (semantics not syntax), the interpretation fails. 
PostScript expects the read operator to obtain the "X" character and 
the next whitespace sequence to be the final CR-LF. 

It seems like I need advance warning that a CR-LF sequence is coming 
before a name operator like "read" is executed. But the next token 
has not yet been requested by the parser.

Any thoughts on how to get out of this?

   Regards,

      Steve

Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLR cpp-generated example crashes on Cygwin
Message-ID: <brso3f+4j8c@eGroups.com>

Hi all,

Sorry if you get this message twice (anyway I've added some comments
that missed in the first one).

I've started to use antlr on WinXP/Cygwin, and successfully followed
the Ashish's working recipe (very good BTW). The main antlr program
works ok generating the java lexer/parser of the Terrence's example
(http://www.antlr.org/article/firstgr/index.html).

Since I need to use the cpp option, I followed another of the
getting-started examples
(http://www.merrells.com/john/blog/archives/000100.html) to see if
everithing was set ok. The build-process works fine
(cppp/hpp files are generated, compiled, and linked against
libantlr.a), but the program crashes with segm-fault when typing a
line that matches an expresion defined in the *.g file (If I typed a
non-matching expression an error is displayed that looks like
normal, but the segm-fault is still present).

As a comment, I'm initializing the ASTFactory (there's a similar
problem in the group that was solved by inserting such initialization
in the main program:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/antlr-interest/message/8322).

Also, I've updated to the most recent version of Cygwin.

Any help will be appreciated.

> Hello Marcin,

Of course, this grammar is meant to be well-formed logical formulae grammar.
I have eliminated left recursion, also performed factorization of the
grammar. It is :
F->DF'
F'->ifthen F | epsilon
D->CD'
D'->or CD' | epsilon
C->NC'
C'->and NC' | epsilon
N->not N | P
P->var | (F)

In ANTLR it is like:
formula
 returns [Formula f]
 { f = null; Formula f1; Formula f2; }
  :  f1=disjunction f2=sformula
   {
   if (f2!=null) {
    f = new Formula();
    f.setType(CONDITIONAL);
      f.attachLeft (f1);
    f.attachRight (f2);
   } else
    f = f1;
   }
  ;

sformula
 returns [Formula f]
 { f = null; }
  :  IF_THEN f=formula
                | //epsilon
  ;

disjunction
 returns [Formula f]
 { f = null; Formula f1; Formula f2;}
  :  f1=conjunction f2=sdisjunction
   {
   if (f2!= null) {
    f = new Formula();
    f.setType(DISJUNCTION);
    f.attachLeft (f1);
    f.attachRight (f2);
   } else
    f = f1;
   }
  ;
and so on

What do you mean by using ? and + instead eliminating left recursion? I
don't quite catch it. :-)

Subject: [antlr-interest] How to parser {******} and {!{***********}!}?
Message-ID: <brtqpp+64l1@eGroups.com>

I am trying to write a SRGS ABNF parser. There are two tag formats, 
which I think stupid.

{ ******* }
{!{ ********* }!}

Within the tags can be anything. 

The first format is easy, I used:
TAG	:	'{'! 
		(
		options{ 
			generateAmbigWarnings=false;
			}
		:	"\r\n" {newline();}
		|	'\r'	{newline();}
		|	'\n'	{newline();}
		|	~('}'|'\n'|'\r')
		)*
		'}'!
                ;

But I have no idea how to deal with the other format.

It gets a bit messy, but you want to do something like

protected
TagBody
    ;
 		(
 		options{ 
 			generateAmbigWarnings=false;
 			}
 		:	"\r\n" {newline();}
 		|	'\r'	{newline();}
 		|	'\n'	{newline();}
 		|	~('}'|'\n'|'\r')
 		)*
    ;


TAG
    :
    '{'
     (    "!{"
          (    TagBody
          |    '}' ('!' ~('}') | ~('!')) // } but not }!}
          )*
          "}!}
     )
     |  TagBody '}'
    ;

and you'll need to set k to an appropriate value.

Subject: [antlr-interest] XML parsing - dtd import
Message-ID: <bruh0f+avak@eGroups.com>

Hi All,  
  
I have to parse XML files. the abstract syntax of these files is  
described with a DTD. So I had a simple question. Does a tool exist 
to generate a grammar file for antlr (to generate a token parser,  
building an AST) from a DTD. It would be a (working if possible)  
tool that would have a dtd file in entry and would generate a .g  
file, that would allow the generation of a token parser. 
  
A tool called SmartTools is developped at the inria in france  
(http://www-sop.inria.fr/oasis/SmartTools/st4up/) But this is not  
working yet (it is still a development for a few days/month/year  
(choose the right word)). Does another similar tool exists?  
  
I have to develop a grammar now, but I would not like to change it  
each time the dtd of my xml files change.  
I am not sure that antlr is the right tool for what I am doing, I 
hope it is. I could use XSLT to do the job, but I would prefer not 
use this kind of item... 
  
Thanks  
  
Remi

What antlr version are you using? 2.7.2 ? If so please try a development
snapshot first (http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr/) Do the bundled
examples work ? Could you provide a backtrace of the error (run the binary
in gdb make it crash en do a 'bt')

Cheers,

Ric

I believe there is a FORTRAN grammar somewhere. If you want to know how
to handle fixed length I suspect that would be an excellent example to
study (for those new fogeys out there, semantics are dependent on column
position :-)

Solution?  Do it in the lexer and switch lexer states when you know
you're
going to read a fixed amount of data.  And before switching call the WS
rule
to read all of the whitespace before the data.  I believe there is a
note on
the antlr website or FAQ or manual about reading fixed length records
for
more details.

Thanks for the advice from all. Unfortunately, the records are not 
fixed length - in general they can be any length. The image 
operators usually read a fixed amount of data. I've run into other 
PostScript code that uses the read operators to discard lines of 
input that should not be interpreted. So I cannot make any 
assumptions about the amount of data to be read.

However I did find a solution, albeit a somewhat strange one. 
Instead of attempting to ensure that I could synchronize the input 
stream that the read operators were using with the lookahead stream 
that the scanner was using, I simply built on top of the scanner. 
Since I have no syntactic predicates in my grammar, I added a read() 
method to my lexer:

public int read() throws CharStreamException {
    int output = LA(1);
    if (output == EOF_CHAR) {
        output = PSFile.EOF;
    }
    else {
        consume();
    }
    return output;
}

Now the file operators are reading from the same "stream" that the 
lexer is. Once I match a name object in the lexer, the 
consumeWhiteSpace() method is called:

public void consumeWhiteSpace() throws CharStreamException {
    char value = LA(1);
    if (value == '\r') {
        consume();
        if (LA(1) == '\n') {
            consume();
        }
        newline();
    }
    else {
        if (value == '\n') {
            consume();
            newline();
        }
        else if ((value == ' ') || (value == '\t') ||
                 (value == '\f') ||(value == '\0')) {
            consume();
        }
    }
}

Any objections out there as to why this should not or could work?

   Steve

Subject: [antlr-interest] Context.java, Scope.java, etc... What files they are?
Message-ID: <brv1jm+8ddt@eGroups.com>

Hi, for my thesis I've to comlete another work of a previous student
who started to write a pdl2 interpreter in Java (PDL2 is a proprietary
language from COMAU, it's Pascal-like with some functions and data
types for robotic applications). He used ANTLR so I started to learn
It, but in his files I found the classes listed below. The files are
without comments and are very similar (many are equal) to the files of
Sinan Karasu "TinyBasic" example (antlr/examples/java/tinybasic).

I'd like to know if that files are auto-generated from some tool or,
simply, Sinan wrote them and the work I'm looking at has been based on
his code, adding some data types and modifying some members. I've not
found any reference tho that classes in ANTLR reference manual.

Many thanks,
Simone.

---------------------------------
The files are:

Context.java
Scope.java
GlobalScope.java
ProgramScope.java
DTDataType.java
DTArray1D.java
DTArray2D.java
DTBoolean.java
DTCodeType.java
DTConstFloat.java
DTConstString.java
etc...
etc....

Also, I would inspect the generated code around any of your read()s to
convince yourself that it will behave.  Reading the generated code is a
great way to learn what antlr is doing, and that code is designed to be read
by humans (except the tree building parts :))

Subject: [antlr-interest] Re: Positioning input stream (was EOL sequen ce)

Thanks for the advice from all. Unfortunately, the records are not 
fixed length - in general they can be any length. The image 
operators usually read a fixed amount of data. I've run into other 
PostScript code that uses the read operators to discard lines of 
input that should not be interpreted. So I cannot make any 
assumptions about the amount of data to be read.

However I did find a solution, albeit a somewhat strange one. 
Instead of attempting to ensure that I could synchronize the input 
stream that the read operators were using with the lookahead stream 
that the scanner was using, I simply built on top of the scanner. 
Since I have no syntactic predicates in my grammar, I added a read() 
method to my lexer:

public int read() throws CharStreamException {
    int output = LA(1);
    if (output == EOF_CHAR) {
        output = PSFile.EOF;
    }
    else {
        consume();
    }
    return output;
}

Now the file operators are reading from the same "stream" that the 
lexer is. Once I match a name object in the lexer, the 
consumeWhiteSpace() method is called:

public void consumeWhiteSpace() throws CharStreamException {
    char value = LA(1);
    if (value == '\r') {
        consume();
        if (LA(1) == '\n') {
            consume();
        }
        newline();
    }
    else {
        if (value == '\n') {
            consume();
            newline();
        }
        else if ((value == ' ') || (value == '\t') ||
                 (value == '\f') ||(value == '\0')) {
            consume();
        }
    }
}

Any objections out there as to why this should not or could work?

Are you calling read() from your lexer or parser?  If it's from the parser
there are still potentially issues of synchronization.  If you find yourself
wondering how in the world it could be screwing up I would look there first.

I browsed around the SLK site a bit and guess SLK *nearly* is able to 
solve the SLL(k) computation in polynomial time instead of exponential. 
As far as I understand it uses the fact SLL(k) computation for any 
*fixed* k is polynomial only. So SLK begins to create a table assuming 
the grammar is SLL(1). If it detects an ambiguity it augments it with 
SLL(2), etc. How does ANTLR do it?

Ah, this is interesting. *Obviously this shows LALL' grammars are not a 
subset of SLL grammars*!

What about languages then? As far as I understand from the above there 
is always a way to rephrase your LL grammar to SLL to parse any LL 
language, is this correct? Is it always possible to make a LL grammar 
LALL', parsing the same language? If not the LALL' languages indeed seem 
to be a subset of the SLL languages, right?

Cheers :)

All this makes me wonder if there is any way to have a recursive descent 
compiler generator handling all LL grammars that still has a single 
method per grammar rule? If not is this one of the reasons ANTLR does 
LALL instead of LL?

This grammar is not incomplete, is it? Anyway, this grammar actually is 
LL(1), but this is not the point, the point is it is LALR', but not SLL 
which shows LALR' grammars are not a subset of SLL grammars. As this 
seemed to be the intention of the initial claim, it is wrong, isn't it?

Sorry, of course I wanted to say LALL instead of LALR :(

I can't think of any reason an LL grammar couldn't be one method per rule.
Do you have a counter example?

My understanding of LALL is that it "simply" collapses the search space for
lookahead tests at the expense of some accuracy.  I don't see any reason why
doing that would be related to the one method per rule question.

Actually PCCTS did full LL at one method per rule, and ANTLR 3 should as well.  ANTLR 2 did not implement some important features 
of PCCTS--most notably full LL analysis/code generation and semantic predicate hoisting.  ANTLR 2 was a "rush to market" job while 
Ter was busy starting up jGuru.  At the time, Sriram Srinivasan had started work on JavaCC and was basing the design on PCCTS, 
albeit with some more "conservative" features like parse trees instead of ANTLR-style syntax trees.  Ter had just decided on Java as 
an implementation language after playing around with Sather and some others--by that time, he had developed a passionate dislike of 
C++.

That said, multiple methods per rule would be an internal refactoring of a grammar.  I've given some (not nearly enough) thought to 
grammar refactoring and can identify a few cases.  My bias is to think of tree grammar refactorings, but the current set of possible 
refactorings that I have identified includes (paired, for symmetry):

iteration to recursion (often necessary when using synpreds to determine exits from ()* loops)
recursion to iteration

left factoring
syntactic predication

subrule hoisting (pushing dangling alternatives "upwards")
subrule internment (converse)

rule/subrule replication (often necessary to insert different action sets)
rule/subrule consolidation (a good design of tree grammars often leads to simplification by consolidation--requires care in annotating 
the parser or preceding tree grammars)

inlining of rules (demotion of rule to subrule)
promotion of subrule to rule.

I'd like to build up a reasonably comprehensive list of these--automation assistance for refactoring is an obvious feature to incorporate 
into a workbench.  Anyone have any additions to suggest?

The only reference on approximate lookahead that I know of is the 
original dissertation on antlr.org. It may have a proof, or other 
useful information.

Since t is not on the right side of a production, the t production is 
not reachable in the grammar.

As I said before, LL(1), SLL(1), and LALL(1) are all the same grammar 
class. This is a well-known fact that you can find in any text book. 
So when I said the grammar above was LL(1), that means that it is 
also SLL(1) because they are the same class. Saying "strong LL(1)" is 
redundant because all LL(1) grammars are strong. LL(k) is more 
powerful than LALL(k) and SLL(k) only for k>1. So the example grammar 
given above is not relevant to the question of even LALL vs. SLL, 
much less LALL' vs. SLL.

Howdy :)

This is not possible in theory for k>1 because each lookahead set is 
O(|T|^k) in the worst case.  In practice it's not as bad, but can 
quickly explode for k>2.  The algorithm is irrelevant...this is min 
requirement just to store a *single* lookahead set.

Actually, it can never be polynomial in theory.  The sequence of tokens 
is combinatoric.  Sometimes in practice you can make it do k=7 as I've 
done with antlr on small grammars.

ANTLR does the same thing and that technique has been known for at 
least 30 years (modulating the lookahead depth).

Yep.  Any parser that does SLL or LALL or LL will be exponential for 
k>1.  LL is non linear (can't remember exact order at the moment) even 
for k=1 due to rule replication.

Approximate parsers are always non-exponential, but non linear.  They 
are essentially O(|G|xk) or perhaps a little higher where |G| is the 
size of the grammar.

Correct.  SLL has less precise lookahead computation.

However, I made a mistake in this grammar I just realized...tried to 
simplify.  Here is an LALL(1) grammar that should not be SLL(k).

s : (a|C) B ;

a : A|;

t : a C ;

The problem is that computing lookahead for first alt of subrule you go 
like this:

LOOK(a) == FIRST(a) == {A} U FOLLOW(a)  == A // SLL

whereas an LALL computation will use the fact that it knows which 
context in which 'a' will be invoked and use only the first 
FOLLOW=={B}.  So LALL(1) should compute {A,B} for lookahead of first 
alt of subrule and SLL(1) would compute {A,B,C}, which collides with C 
of second alt.  Sorry for the incorrect grammar.  BTW, LALL'(1) == 
LALL(1) grammar and language.  They are identical functionally and 
hence equivalent in power trivially.

Ah.  That's different.

For k=1, SLL(k)==LL(k).  But this is not true for LL(k) languages with 
k>1.

I'm not certain, but I'd say no: there must be LL(k) languages that are 
not LALL'(k).

No because LL(k) strictly stronger than SLL(k) languages and grammars.  
LALL' weaker than LALL for grammars, but I don't know for languages.  I 
never established that result, sorry.  Therefore, I don't think the 
relationship is so obvious.  The only thing that is clear is that SLK's 
claims about being strongest non-LL(k) parsers is wrong due to PCCTS's 
LALL(k) parsers.

Hi Monty,

It turns out that, bizarre as it seems, indeed full LL parsers are 
nonlinear in just the grammar not just the lookahead.  Let's turn to a 
tweaked version of my LALL test grammar from previous posts:

s : (a|C) B ;

a : A|; // nondeterministic upon A

t : a A ;

This is non-LALL(1) because the lookahead of alt 2 for 'a' is generic 
global FOLLOW(a)=={A,B}.  The A collides with the first alt.  An LL(1) 
parser generator would handle this no problem.  You can convert this to 
an LALL(1) and SLL(1) grammar by duplicating 'a' as follows:

s : (a|C) B ;

a : A|;

a2 : A|;

t : a2 C ;

That extra contextual information is why full LL grammars are more 
expressive than LALL and SLL and gives you a hint why LL(k) languages 
are the strongest.

I think you'll find it says more precisely that LL(1) can be rewritten 
as SLL(1) but they are not the same class of grammars.  Same class of 
languages, though. :)

I just posted an LL(1) grammar that is not LALL(1) nor SLL(1).  You 
have to do the transformation I showed.  The difference between same 
and equivalent gets kinda murky. ;)

And for k=1 grammars, but not languages; just to harp on it for a

Could someone post a definition and explaination of the differences of these:

It's been kinda hard to follow this tennis match :)

I have this reference from

first paragraph, but have no access to the primary source. I do not want 
to make this a research topic, but can anyone verify the link?

The primary source seems to be:

Aho, Alfred V., S.C. Johnson, and Jeffrey D. Ullman (1975). 
"Deterministic Parsing of Ambiguous Grammars." Communications of the 
ACM, 18(8), pp. 441-452.

OK. Is there anything I could read to clear my mind? Is there anyone who 
touched this before in a theoretical way? My mind needs relief and a 
little bit of rest, but I will have to find this out before :( Any hints?

Thanks Ric,

In the mean time I happily made ANTLR-cpp-generated files work on
Cygwin (with both MinGW and CygWin)... It seems that the cpp-example I
used is outdated regarding the ASTFactory-initialization-stuff (which
BTW, I've not understood very well, but I'm in the learning process).

Now my concern is with MSVC++ 6.0/SP5(Yes, I need it to work in both
CygWin and MSVC++): The first try of creating the library from
Klaren's snapshot, threw 1042 errs (here's only a taste):

...\lib\cpp\antlr\circularqueue.hpp(23) : error C2039: '_Vector_val' :
is not a member of 'std'
...\lib\cpp\antlr\circularqueue.hpp(23) : error C2143: syntax error :

...\lib\cpp\antlr\circularqueue.hpp(23) : error C2079: '_Vector_val'

...\lib\cpp\antlr\circularqueue.hpp(24) : error C2059: syntax error : '<'

Since the source of this errors were #conditional compilation, my
first reaction was to comment out all the lines that caused them. And
surprisingly it worked!, but I couldn't try it because the
ANTLR-generated CPP files had being produced with antlr2.7.2 (Abstract
classes weren't being fully imlplemented according to the headers of
the snapshot). So I tryed to compile the full test snapshot following
the same cygwing-recipe... it didn't work:

OK, I know why the snapshot didn't build: There is a bunch of missing
*.class files in the antlr/ dir (among them the antlr.Tool class)
which are present in the 2.7.2 version.

I used "bootstrap" make's target to generate them and now I have the
test-snapshot working in Cygwin. I had to modify script/config.make's
ANTLR_BOOTSTRAP variable (similar to the Cygwin-working-recipe):

ANTLR_BOOSTRAP = $(JAVA) -cp "<windows/path/to/your/antlr.jar>" \ 
       antlr.Tool

Hope this one works... if don't, be sure I'll be here soon.


Thanx

Just for the record:

- The compiled antl.Tool class crashes when is called with no
arguments (I don't know if this issue is present in stable versions):

[~]$ antlr
ANTLR Parser Generator   Version 2.7.3 (20031220-1)   1989-2003 jGuru.com
#$%%*&@# internal error: java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException:
String index
 out of range: 0
[complain to nearest government official
 or send hate-mail to parrt@jguru.com;
 please send stack trace with report.]
java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 0
        at java.lang.String.charAt(String.java:444)
        at antlr.preprocessor.Tool.processArguments(Tool.java:124)
        at antlr.preprocessor.Tool.<init>(Tool.java:25)
        at antlr.Tool.doEverything(Tool.java:215)
        at antlr.Tool.main(Tool.java:399)

I'm not a java expert, so I don't know how to get the stack-trace
(BTW, I won't send hate-mail to Mr. Parr ;) ), but it seems that the
issue is very reproducible and obvious.

- The link to the latest Klaren's snapshot is broken. Due a typo (I
assume) it actually links to the previous one. Here is the correct one
(guessed from the name):
http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr/antlr-20031211.tar.gz
There is no problem generating the static library with this version in
MSVC 6.0/SP5

Hello again,
I noticed on the home page of antlr.org that exist a book called
"ANTLR and SORCERER tools":

"Testimonials
The ANTLR and SORCERER tools [the book] describes should be useful for
those writing any kind of a translator, including those writing
sophisticated compilers. I recommend it highly.
Richard Stearns, Co-inventor of LL(k)"

Where It can be found?

Strange...works for me, but could be a weird thing on cygwin or  
something.  Oh, a compiled version... hmm...

Subject: [antlr-interest] Bad Token-type to AST-Class map in 2.7.2 Java; broken release
In-Reply-To: <bqs0qt+aurb@eGroups.com>
Message-ID: <EACBB176-3351-11D8-BDC7-000A95891192@cs.usfca.edu>

Hi Thomas,

Looks ok to me at the moment:

     protected void buildTokenTypeASTClassMap() {
         tokenTypeToASTClassMap = new Hashtable();
         tokenTypeToASTClassMap.put(new Integer(4), 
persist.qtree.Node.class);
         tokenTypeToASTClassMap.put(new Integer(5), 
persist.qtree.ThisExpr.class)
;
     };

for this simple grammar:

class P extends Parser;

options {
     buildAST = true;
}

tokens {
IMPORT_ON_DEMAND          <AST=persist.qtree.Node>;
FOO = "foo"             <AST=persist.qtree.ThisExpr>;
}

a : FOO ;

Can you tell me more about your switches or whatever?

Thanks!
Ter

Also on solaris I've seen problems with a gcj compiled one. So far I've
only been able to make a stable binary on Redhat 9. No clue what the cause
of it is. I guess we'll give the gcj build experimental status ;)

Sorry about that :( I must have forgotten to update the link itself. Fixed
it just now. Glad to hear that MSVC6 static build works now. DLL I wouldn't
try on MSVC6 (but i'm told it can be done with STLport and some hacking)

Did this last snapshot work well with cygwin/mingw ?

Hi !!!
In the middle of file parsing,I need to search a  word(let's say $ROLE) in
the same file,store the value of that word and again start the parsing from
the same location where I had left earlier.
Actually, right now after searching $ROLE, parsing gets start from this
word($ROLE) onwards.Thus skips some lines of file.
How can I go back to the same place which I had left for searching keyword?
I hope someone will definitely help me.

Nijesh

I think I experienced something like this when I implemented a SIP/MGCP parser.
 
Try saving the lexer context with

int posInLexer = ((antlr::CharScanner*)(selector->getCurrentStream()))->mark();

and restore it when you want with

((antlr::CharScanner*)(selector->getCurrentStream()))->rewind(posInLexer);

See if the parser token stack has a valid state.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Character/String Constants

Message-ID: <200312221446.IAA24453@coral.propagation.net>

Is it possible to define character or string constants?

For example, if I use '0'..'9' in lots of places, I'd like to define a
constant called DIGIT.

I know that in the Lexer I could have a "protected DIGIT: '0'..'9';"
definition, but this generates an additional member function.  The desire is
to have this be "inlined" with no member function.

If this isn't supported in 2.7.2, is it planned for a future release (3?)?

Thanks,

- Tom

OK, there's a little confusion with the term I used to refer the
java-generated class (I didn't mean binary-compiled... sorry). This
crash isn't related with gcj, and again, I'm not sure if this is only
present in the 2.7.3 test-version or is just because I did something
wrong in my environment configuration or build process (which was
adapted from the cygwin-working recipe).

So far, the snapshot was built under cygwin/mingw/j2sdk1.4.2_03 (with
a little variation from the cygwin-work-recipe), and it successfully
generated a the calc-cpp example, which I only successfully checked in
MSVC (and then, I went to sleep :)  ). As I said before, this
antl.Tool only crashes if it is called with no *.g as argument.

Sorry.  The on-the-fly compiler should inline small functions though.  
It might not however...i do some inlining as a side-effect of auto-left 
factoring and LL-regular analysis for ANTLR 3. :)

Subject: [antlr-interest] parsing problem
Message-ID: <bs90te+fd86@eGroups.com>

Hi,

I have a problem parsing the following syntax:
The format is a kind of serialized objects which are dumped like this:
Each object name is prefixed with one or more dots where the number of
dots describe the context in which the object is used. E.g.:

.PAD "103th thermal"
..4_WEB_ROUND_THERMAL_45
...DIAMETER 103
...TIE_LEG_WIDTH 12
...THERMAL_CLEARANCE 12
..TIMESTAMP "1998/07/10@20:03:20"
..PAD_OPTIONS  USER_GENERATED_NAME
..OFFSET (0, 0)

That means I have an object "PAD" (of name "103th thermal") with
members 4_WEB_ROUND_THERMAL_45, TIMESTAMP, PAD_OPTIONS and OFFSET.
4_WEB_ROUND_THERMAL_45 itself is an object with the members DIAMETER,
TIE_LEG_WIDTH and THERMAL_CLEARANCE.
My problem now is that identical members can appear in objects and
their members. So I have to take into account the 'context' where they
appear. That means that I have to evaluate the (number of) dots to
be able to decide if an entry is a member of the current object or
a member of the super object.
Can somebody give me a hint how to do that?

Subject: [antlr-interest] Subclassing from CPPParser
Message-ID: <61051.81.86.229.220.1072206495.squirrel@webmail.lsbu.ac.uk>

I am trying to place all our project code in a subclass of
CPPParser but I cannot get the subclassing to work.

I am using MSVC 6.0 with Antlr-2.7.1 to generate (C++) parser
in C++.

After inserting even the bare bones of a subclass I cannot get
rid of the following message,

e:\java\antlr-2.7.1\java-cpp\mycode.cpp(9) : error C2512:
'CPPParser' : no appropriate default constructor available

All the help file says is,

"No default constructor was available for the specified class,
structure, or union.

The compiler will supply a default constructor only if
user-defined constructors are not provided. If you provide a
constructor that takes a nonvoid parameter, then you must also
provide a default constructor. The default constructor can be
called with no parameters, that is, a constructor with default
values for all parameters."

Helpful, isn't it!

However, if I supply a default constructor for CPPParser I
then get a similar message for LLkParser but this doesn't
happen without the Mycode subclass!

I would be grateful if someone could suggest what I might be
doing wrong.

The subclass code is,

Mycode.hpp
----------
#include "CPPParser.hpp"

class Mycode : public CPPParser
    {
    Mycode();
    };

Mycode.cpp
----------
#include "Mycode.hpp"

Mycode::Mycode()
    {
    }

main.cpp
--------
#include "CPPLexer.hpp"
#include "CPPParser.hpp"

#include "Mycode.hpp"

Mycode mycode();
or
Mycode *mycode = new Mycode();


Thanks,

David.

Thomas--

While you could count dots in the parser, it's probably easier to 
have a
DOTS : ('.')+ ;

rule in the lexer and use semantic predicates:

a
    : 
    d:DOTS
    (    { #d.getText().length() == 2 }? foo
    |    bar
    )
    ;

for example.  Or you could have a

dots
returns [ int count ]
    :
    d:DOTS { count = #d.getText().length(); }
    ;

and use the return value for a case statement in an action.

Ah ok :) Hmm weird I have no trouble with the snapshot version, will
probably be next year before I look at it. Could you verify your setup ? I
have no trouble running the bundled antlr.jar with java 1.4.2_02 on windows
xp sp1, so I'd expect some configuration problem or maybe a broken class
file.

Cheers,

Ric

You could work around this by explicitly calling the right constructor for
the super class from the constructor from Mycode or mimic the constructors
from the superclasses in Mycode and then just pass on the constructor
arguments:

Mycode( antlr::TokenStream& lexer, int k )
: CPPParser( lexer, k )
{
}

(not 100% sure if the k is in that constructor per default, check the
generated constructors for CPPParser to see which one you need)

So here a implicit call to the default constructor of CPPParser is made
which probably does not exist. Another option is to call one of the
existing constructors from the CppParser with some more or less sane
defaults from the default constructor from MyCode.

Mycode()
: CPPParser( some_lexer, some_k )
{
}

Hope this helps you back on track, sorry I'm not very specific on the
constructors I don't have the code handy at the moment.

Cheers,

What is the point of your reply, and your post to the list?  The statements
are confrontational and contain no real information.  If you disagree with
Terence, we would enjoy the opportunity to understand your point of view,
and to be able to all learn more.

Just my opinion...

Hmmm, the misunderstanding seems to be based on the difference between 
SLL (=simply LL) and strong-LL. As indicated by the reference Sarah 
already gave:

http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dick/PTAPG.html

p. 174, 8.2.3 claims every strong-LL(1) is LL(1) and the other way 
round, but not true for k > 1. This is what Sarah says. Now on p.167, 
8.1 it says *simple LL(1)* also called *SLL(1)* is a subset of LL(1) 
which is obvious when we have a look at the informal definition: "all 
right-hand sides of a non-terminal start with a different terminal 
symbol". That's what Terence said. Both are more or less right then, but 
were just using those confusing names differently.

So, folks, calm down :)

Oliver

Sorry, I was wrong, the source is:

LR(k) testing," CACM, 18:12, pp. 707-716.

OK, finally bought it from the ACM, hope it was worth it ;) What I found 
out is in section 3 where *lower* bounds for LR(k) are computed using 
s-grammars (=simple LL grammars=SLL). The result is the lower bound is 
either polynomial (if k is expressed unary) or exponential (otherwise) 
in time for a *non-deterministic* Turing machine.

This either means
- I made a mistake somewhere
- the claim made in 
http://home.earthlink.net/~parsersinc/doc/conjecture.html is wrong

As this ACM text is pretty clear in stating these results are for 
non-deterministic times, I am afraid the polynomial claim of SLK is 
simply *wrong*. I will be open to any argument provig the opposite.

Cheers :)

Hi Oliver,

Interesting...never heard of "simple LL(k)".  I've only seen SLL(k) to 
mean Strong LL(k).  Anyway, I don't think we've been confusing that ;)

I am on vacation so I don't have my parsing theory books handy.  I'm 
going from memory, which we all know can be flawed. ;)  Particularly 
mine. (anybody seen my car keys? <snicker>).  My confusion arises from 
this grammar, which is clearly LALL(1) as ANTLR and PCCTS gulp it down. 
  [To ensure that rule t is called, I'll add it to the end of rule s for 
fun even though it is unnecessary.]

s : s2 B t ;

s2 : a | C ;

a : A | ;

t : a C ;

The Grune/Jacob book aside for the moment, I believe this grammar is 
not SLL(1).  Can anybody run this through an SLL(1) parser generator to 
simply check?  I remember SLL(k) computing the lookahead as simply 
FIRST(alpha FOLLOW(A)) for A->alpha without concern for any 
left-context (hence it's weakness compared to LALL and full LL).  Here, 
the lookahead for production

s2 : a

yields FIRST(a)==A union FOLLOW(a) which is {A,B,C}.  Since {C} also 
predicts

s2 : C

there is a conflict between the alternatives of rule s2 upon input C.  
Yet, ANTLR properly computes the "local" FOLLOW by taking advantage of 
some left-context--it knows that the rule t can never be called from s2 
and hence computing lookahead for the epsilon transfer of rule 'a' 
should not include C (from rule t).  When asked for full FOLLOW(a), 
ANTLR correctly gave me {B,C}, by the way.

As I've said before, you can transform this LALL(1)/LL(1) grammar to 
SLL(1) easily by duplicating rule 'a'.

I may be going crazy, but I think this is a simple proof by existence 
that there exists at least one grammar that is LALL(1), hence LL(1), 
that is not SLL(1).  One needs only to show that this grammar is also 
SLL(1) to shoot me down.  An easy kill. ;)

I think something is wrong with Grune/Jacob's book. ;)

I try to compile antlr-2.7.2 on my GNU/Linux system with gcc-3.3
there was no problem with the configure, but for the make I got this :

I am for sure no expert in anything, but I still think terms got 
confused, even though this is not your fault or Sarah's. Most books seem 
to use the definition for SLL given above and associate it with "strong 
LL" being the same. Now Grune/Jacobs have *a different* definition of 
"strong LL" and call it "strong-LL" which really is something else "all 
entries in the parse table have at most one element, i.e. it is 
deterministic". Using this definition strong-LL and LL are in the same 
class of grammars, i.e. every LL grammar is strong-LL and every 
strong-LL grammar is LL.

What is the definition of SLL you use, it seems to be neither of the 
ones given by Grune/Jacobs. Even if you are not confused, I am ;)

Subject: [antlr-interest] cgram build error in Antlr-20031211(2.7.3)
Message-ID: <bsc91o+onvl@eGroups.com>

Hi,
2.7.3 from R. Klaren builds nicely under VC6.0 (WIN2000) and I can
successfully Antlr the examples (like calc and tinyc).  I have also 
been able to build the CGRAM project using NMAKE on the include
makefile located in the Grammars directory of cgram using both 
2.7.1 and 2.7.2.

When I try to NMAKE the CGRAM files at the command line using 2.7.3 I
get the following error:

ANTLR Parser Generator  Version 2.7.3 (20031209-72)  1989-2003

   at java.security.SecureClassLoader.defineClass(Unknown Source),
etc.

Any ideas?  Thanks

Grab a snapshot from http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr/

(Or wait for the 2.7.3 prerelease or search the archive for the fix

Try rebuilding the java files manually or following the instructions for
the java build from the docs and rebuild the antlr.jar. Which java version
are you using ?

Hi Ric,
I'm using JDK 1.3.1.  Do I need to upgrade?  I'm not a java expert,
but I will see if I can rebuild things as you suggested.

Both Ter and I mean SLL to be strong LL.

Simple LL did in fact use the name SLL first, but simple LL is 
useless, so stealing the name is ok, I think.

Now I feel bad. This is unfair if you do not have your books handy. 
Please believe me when I say that LL(1)==SLL(1), at least until you 
can check for yourself. The grammar you gave is SLL(1).

What you may be thinking of is that cannonical LL(1) parsers are 
sometimes able to detect errors slightly sooner than SLL(1) parsers. 
But the classes of grammars are identical.

Clearly, if SLK could solve an NP-complete problem in polynomial 
time, that would constitute a proof that P=NP. But the conjecture 
given is that P!=NP, so it seems that you misread something.

I don't need to make some new compiler/language etc. I just need to

Not quite sure, let's do it step by step, quoting from the beginning of 
http://home.earthlink.net/~parsersinc/doc/conjecture.html:

> The complexity of testing context-free grammars for the SLL(k) property 
> was first investigated by Hunt, Szymanski, and Ullman (1975). They

Which from my understanding is clearly false as this article *at most* 
proves it is in NP as the lower bound estimation was for 
"non-deterministic" time. This is because for a "non-deterministic" TM 
it is polynomial time, thus the lower bound is clearly in *NP*, not *P*. 
Do you agree? Maybe I am missing something, can you see what this might be?

Thanks in advance and cheers :)

Oliver

*SORRY*

To my complete dismay, I really misread something. The complexity stuff 
from section 3 I quoted was for "non-fixed" k. Which is in total 
accordance with what is written in paragraph 2. For unary k it is in NP, 
for non-unary in NE. And indeed there is this proof for LR(k) testing is 
in P. *OOPS* again... Seeing it in this light, all this stuff really 
makes much sense to me. Just to check, this means SLK does table 
generation in polynomial time in most cases, but not all, like for the 
grammar given there. Is this correct now?

As the proof is far beyond of what I can understand in less than a day I 
am afraid, can you tell me if it is constructive, i.e. if you can use it 
to actually generate the parse table with it?

By the way, Sarah, are you the auhor of the docs at 
http://home.earthlink.net/~parsersinc/ ?

Thanks again :)

Ter and I were working a language that we were calling "C+-" that we were
going to use for various (kinds of) projects including ANTLR v2.

When Java came out we found a language that was close enough to our needs,
had the backing of a good sized organization, and was rapidly gaining
traction in the market so we bailed out of C+- and became Java gurus.

Happy Holidays!

Subject: [antlr-interest] a quick one!
Message-ID: <bsfd08+bssb@eGroups.com>

Please someone answer, it wouldn't take you more than 5 minutes!

I'm investigating ANTLR. I need to know whether there is a viable
C++ grammer as I want to be able to parse my C++ code and (let's
say) generate some functions for every class (e.g. classA.toString
(), classA.toSQL()). Is that possible with ANTLR, if yes how do we
go about it? Please anyone help.... I really need it.

I don't need to make some new compiler/language etc. I just need to
automate some of the coding. Just as I said I need to have some
parser that parses my C++ code, checks my classes and auto-generate
some 'straightforward' functions.

Please help me!

Thanks!  Wow...my memory sucks.  That's SLL(1), eh?  Strange.  Oh well. 
  I better go back and read my thesis.  I think I understood things 10 
years ago. ;)   What must be the difference then between LALL and SLL 
lookahead computations?  Perhaps you are actually building LALL 
parsers?  I thought I was doing SLL until I read these wacky parsing 
books and then decided I was doing LALL. ;)

Yeah, i remember that part.

> But the classes of grammars are identical.

Hmm...still something is bothering me.  I'll have to dig thru the 
parsing books when I get back.  i've got some really scary dense 
parsing books that made it all clear to me 10 years ago.   Perhaps it's 
an EBNF vs BNF thing.  The following should be SLL(1) too, though, 
right?

s : (a|C) B t ;

a : A|;

t : a C ;

More likely my confusion is that I'm so used to k>1 that my brain just 
improperly back extrapolated to k=1.

BTW, what are your thoughts on a strict ordering for SLL(k) vs 
LALL'(k)?  I don't think there is a strict ordering.  SLL(k) has the 
advantage in sequence information for lookahead, but LALL has the local 
vs global FOLLOW accuracy.  The only trouble is that, taking your word 
that the above grammar is SLL(1), what could possibly distinguish LALL 
from SLL?  For certain they have the same parsing states and therefore 
can differ only in the lookahead computation.  Ok, what about the 
following grammar, which I believe is LALL(2), but not SLL(2):

A -> aBc
A -> ad
A -> C
B -> b
B ->
C -> cBd

According to my prior understanding of SLL(2), the problem is that 
SLL(2) assumes lookahead of {ab,ac,ad} predicts production one of A 
even though lookahead ad is not possible; lookahead ad collides with 
the prediction of production 2.  LALL(2) sees the lookahead as {ab,ac} 
for production one, hence, has no collision.  Can you confirm/correct 
the SLL(2) lookahead computations for me?  Now that I think about it 
though, SLL(2) should be able to see the correct lookahead too.  Seems 
that LOOK_2(aBc) should be FIRST_2(aBc) which is {ab,ac}, the only 
strings generated by aBc.  Hmm...I'll just wait to hear back from you 
about it's membership.

Anyway, if the above is not SLL(2), then (because LALL'(2) lookahead is 
identical to LALL(2) lookahead in this case), it appears that LALL'(2) 
has at least one grammar that is not SLL(2).  Can you confirm for me 
before I decide I'm totally nuts?! ;)  If that's SLL(2), then I'm at a 
loss for the diff between LALL and SLL.  It'll be back to the parsing 
theory books for 2 weeks of intense re-education.  yikes!

Happy holidays or upcoming happy new year or whatever to all...

Thanks,
Ter

I believe you'll see a response to this from a few times in the past 
using a search.  The answer is C++ is really hard to parse...most 
people parse it in stages, which ANTLR certainly is capable of doing.  
Have you seen the existing C++ grammar on the website?

Hi Ter,

Believe me I did a search and read tons of posts. I understood that 
parsing C++ was difficult (I had a look at the grammar, furtively 
though). But I would think that parsing the C++ code just to add 
some "easy funtions" like adding a toString(); function to all 
classes wouldn't be that hard.

For instance a class 

classA{ 
int i;
int j;
...
}

Parsing the code would generate

classA::toString(){
cout << "i: " << i << ", " << "j: " << j << endl;
....
}


Is that possible with ANTLR?

I read once about some product that parses C++ and offers a Script 
like language (interface) to walk the tree and generate C++ code or 
whatever. But I cannot find it anymore... 

Anyways... I'm really in an extreemly bad mood :(. I accepted some 
project and I'm stuck now... I have been told that there exists some 
C++ grammar and that could be easily done with ANTL. 

Apparently I should have investigated the matter further!

Thank you in any case :)

Subject: [antlr-interest] A little problem in actions
Message-ID: <3FEADB5A.2080803@rainbow.cs.unipi.gr>

Hello all.
I'd like to report a little problem which I am facing.

Consider this rule in a tree parser:
expression
   :
   ...rules
   |! #(EQ_COMP eq_comp1:expression { #eq_comp1 = getDefault(#eq_comp1);} 
eq_comp2:expression { #eq_comp2 = getDefault(#eq_comp2);
//int code = EQ_COMP;
#expression = #([EQ_COMP, "="], #eq_comp1, #eq_comp2);
   ;

When the produced parser is compiled, this error apears.
========================================================
Found 1 semantic error compiling 
"/home/e/code/java/aspParser/build/src/gr/omadak/leviathan/asp/VbsTree.java"
expression_AST = (AST)astFactory.make( (new 
ASTArray(3)).add(astFactory.create(tmp33_AST,"=")).add(eq_comp1_AST).add(eq_comp2_AST));
Semantic Error: No applicable overload for the method named "create" was found 
in type "antlr.ASTFactory". Perhaps you wanted the overloaded version 
"antlr.collections.AST create(antlr.Token $1, java.lang.String $2);" instead?
=========================================================

T guess this happens because the EQ_COMP in the action is miss taken as the 
token EQ_COMP in the matching rule.
The problem is easily solved if instead i rewrite the rule:
expression
   :
   ...rules
   |! #(EQ_COMP eq_comp1:expression { #eq_comp1 = getDefault(#eq_comp1);} 
eq_comp2:expression { #eq_comp2 = getDefault(#eq_comp2);
int code = EQ_COMP;
#expression = #([code, "="], #eq_comp1, #eq_comp2);
   ;

However this is awkward.

Well, rewriting the token stream is now pretty easy; see my latest 
article:

http://www.antlr.org/article/rewrite.engine/index.tml

On the other hand, parsing to figure out when to do the rewriting is 
pretty hard.  Fortunately, it sounds like you have an easier problem 
than parsing the whole language.  Just adding some toString methods and 
so on should be pretty easy.

I remember parsing stuff outside of method bodies as much easier than 
parsing stuff inside (at least 10 years ago).  So, you might get away 
with a C++ subset parser. :)

Well, if you can specify the exact augmentations you have to generate, 
we should be able to help you out ;)

Yeah, this is because the action translation stuff sees EQ_COMP as  
#EQ_COMP when inside the #(...).  Try EQ_COMP.getType() instead, which  
should work.

Thanks Terence,

Well, rewriting the token stream is now pretty easy; see my latest 
article:

http://www.antlr.org/article/rewrite.engine/index.tml

On the other hand, parsing to figure out when to do the rewriting is 
pretty hard. Fortunately, it sounds like you have an easier problem 
than parsing the whole language. Just adding some toString methods and 
so on should be pretty easy.

I remember parsing stuff outside of method bodies as much easier than 
parsing stuff inside (at least 10 years ago). So, you might get away 
with a C++ subset parser. :)

Hi Terence,
 
Haven't seen this part: :):
 
Well, if you can specify the exact augmentations you have to generate, 
we should be able to help you out ;)
 
Here it goes... I think it's extreemely interesting and it opens up many oportunities:
 
The point is being able to write any C++ constructs to some XML form. 
We can go further and talk about XML Reflection.
 
classA{
 int i;
 int j;
}

classA objectA(3,4);
 
objectA.toXML() => something like:
 
<classA>
<objectA>  
<i><int>3</int></i>  
<j><int>4</int></j>
</classA>
</objectA>
 
Cheers!

Some possible resources:

David Wigg's upgrade of the PCCTS-based C++ parser should be usable
(<http://www.antlr.org/grammar/cpp>)

SWIG (www.swig.org) may also be usable--it includes a C++ subset 
parser.

The Ovid project (<http://ovid.tigris.org/>) has a few things that 
might help, although it is still very primitive.

One thing to think about: have the lexer scarf entire method bodies as 
a single token.  Thanks to LL-based lexers, you can have the lexer 
track and scarf nested curlies. :)  You could probably do something as 
simple as ignoring everything but curlies and comments and strings.

Message-ID: <bskkkb+qcu9@eGroups.com>

Hi,

I am a developer at www.argouml.org(opensource uml tool) and we use
the java.g grammar for reverse engineering to uml. Sometimes we get
these exceptions thrown and I hope that with the information I provide
you can help identify the problem and what we can do to fix it.

Below is the logged exception and filename it happened in, then a
snippet from the java file itself and then a brief statement to say
where the position of the error is.

we use a modified java.g, which you can find here if it helps:
http://argouml.tigris.org/source/browse/argouml/src_new/org/argouml/uml/reveng/java/java.g?rev=1.18&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup

Also, the java files do compile.

thanks in advance
Alex

Howdy...can you grab a later version of the java.g file?  I'm about to  
release 2.7.3 ANTLR which will have an updated java.g.  I see so far:

  * Version 1.21 (October 17, 2003)

Though I have some fixes to put in still.

It doesn't.I tried EQ_COMP.getType() and #EQ_COMP.getType() but it fails in both 
cases.When dot follows Token code, is treated as an int.
Even if it worked, it would be a hack.
I think that antlr could figure out that is the Token code I am referring to,
since there would be no meaning in a construct like [astObject, label].

Subject: [antlr-interest] Is c# antlr slow
Message-ID: <bssqim+bru8@eGroups.com>

I ahve the following .g files. It all compiles well.
If i try to parse a short line like in the following c# main it 
takes more than 1 second to execute parser.expression(); which of 
course is inacceptable. I am not sure what antlr is doing so long???

class Test 
{
	public static void Main(string[] args) 
	{
	
		SimpleLexer lexer = new SimpleLexer(new StringReader
("trans1.Position [1 11   0   ](.hy \"hallo\" 12 [[1 2 3] [2 4 8 7] 
[3 0 1] [  4  9  876 12   ]   ]) "));
		SimpleParser parser = new SimpleParser(lexer);
		

		// Parse the input expression
		KernelServer ks = new KernelServer();
		Console.WriteLine(ks.TimeServer.Time);
		parser.expression();
		Console.WriteLine(ks.TimeServer.Time);
		CommonAST t = (CommonAST)parser.getAST();
			
		// Print the resulting tree out in LISP notation
		Console.Out.WriteLine(t.ToStringTree());
	}
}

Btw i use the following geramme:

options {
	language = "CSharp";
}


class SimpleParser extends Parser;
options {
	buildAST = true;	// uses CommonAST by default
	k=1;
}

expression	: 	assignment | command 			
						
		;
assignment	: 	VAR ASSIGN! (command | VAR | literal) 	
		;
command		: 	commandname (parameter)*  		
						
		;
commandname	: 	IDENT (DOT! IDENT)? | DOT! IDENT	
		;
parameter	: 	LPAREN! command RPAREN! | VAR | literal 
						
		;
literal		: 	affine | STRING | FLOAT			
						
		;
affine		: 	LBRACK! (matrix | vector)  RBRACK!
		;

RBRACK! LBRACK! vector RBRACK! (LBRACK! vector RBRACK!)?
		;
vector          :       FLOAT FLOAT FLOAT (FLOAT)?
		;
		
		

class SimpleLexer extends Lexer;
options {
	k=1;
}


WS		:	(' '|'\t'|'\r'|'\n')
			{ _ttype = Token.SKIP; }
		;

LPAREN		:	'('
		;

RPAREN		:	')'
		;
LBRACK		:	'['
		;

RBRACK		:	']'
		;
ASSIGN		:	'='
		;

DOT		:	'.'
		;
	
STRING		:	'"' (~('"'|'\\'))* '"'
		;

IDENT       	:	('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'_') 
('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'_'|'0'..'9')*
		;

VAR		:	'$' IDENT
		;
		
FLOAT		:	('0'..'9')+
		;

I hope someone can help me with that?

Also why does antlr generate such ugly code, at least in c# 
(horrible)?

Bye,

Alton

Message-ID: <200312311619.hBVGJCm32363@toulouse.bbn.com>

   On the theory that I many need to parse some modern IDL in the near
future, I've been hacking on Jim Coker's IDL grammar to add CORBA 3.x
features and AST creation. I have something that seems to be working
reasonably well and would be interested in any comments. I'll try
attaching it to this message, but if Yahoo decides to eat the attachment
I can put it up on the web.
