The ASTPair hack gave some 30% reduced garbage and 20% increased speed (on
my anyway handoptimized lexer and recognizer)
 
As for the guessing state hack - I took the enormous effort (that turned out
to be 20 minutes with the help of refactoring browser I am developing) to
make a copy of recognizer and make duplicates of all methods for 'guessing
mode' by hand. This only gave some 7-8% improvement. For vanilla antlr
generated recognizer that would be 3% so it's not such a good thing.

Yes, you're right, you wouldn't necessarily need the guessing state as an
int, it could be boolean or implied by the code path.  Guess you would have
to try it to see how it works.
Do you know how much speed improvement you gained by your ASTPair hack?

&gt;<i> You could do that but you still have to have guessing guards around
</I>individual productions, of course.  And you still have to increment and
decrement the &gt; guessing state just as happens now because syntactic
predicates can be nested arbitrarily.

Are you sure? 
  
I think we would not need the guessing guard nor increment/decrement. 
  
When code sees a syntatic predicate then it would not to
'guessing++;statement();guessing--' but rather 'statementGuessing();' -
statementGuessing would call only guessing rules. It does not matter if the
predicates are nested or not because guessing mode ends only when this
statementGuessing is completed.

This is same for current mode - only currently the inputstate.guessing
becomes 2 when there is a nested predicate and 3 when yet another - it does
not matter because the guessing variable is only tested for 0/nonzero
anyway.

&gt;<i> Just how much guessing is your code doing? 
</I>  
I am using java.g grammar from resources section - I really don't if it can
be optimized- I can say that the hack I sent earlyer reduced ASTPair object
generation by 30 percent (calculated this way that percentages look larger
:<i>).

Just how much guessing is your code doing?  Some people overuse syntactic
predicates because they don't understand proper factoring of rules or they
don't think about the shortest syntactic predicate that will work.  But with
a truly ambiguous language you will have no choice but to use syntactic
predicates.
