<PRE>Hi Jim,

Would you mind elaborating on this just a bit? You bring up this same 
concept quite frequently on this list, but there is something that I am 
missing. I understand how matching more generically in earlier stages 
will lead to better error message in later stages, but this seems to me 
to be very inefficient. Taking the GUID example, you could have a very 
simple lexer rule:

GUID: '{' (HEX_DIGIT|'-')+ '}';

This would match a valid GUID, as well as something close (including a 
lot of common mistaken forms I'm sure). This assumes that the parsing 
stage will validate this token further in its semantics. That's all well 
and good, but the problem is now you have to implement a GUID parser 
within the semantic actions of the original parser. A GUID is a rather 
simple example, so I could easily whip up some string manipulation code 
to validate the format, but this seems a bit odd to me. The whole reason 
we are using ANTLR in the first place is to avoid writing our own 
recognizers from scratch, so I feel like I shouldn't need to write one 
within the semantics of the ANTLR generated one. Would this be an 
appropriate use case for island grammars? This seems like a lot of added 
complexity (in both written code and execution time), seemingly only for 
the benefit of better error messages. The beauty of Chris's original 
implementation of GUID is that it does not require any validation in 
semantics - the lexer will only match a completely valid GUID. As you 
said, the error message may not seem all that helpful. The example that 
I gave above has nearly the same problem though. It will allow you to 
put the '-' anywhere in the GUID, but will give just as bad of an error 
if a '~' character is in the middle of the input. So perhaps a better 
lexer rule would be:

GUID: '{' ~('}')+ '}'

Which will accept all sorts of screwed up syntax, but allow you to 
produce an error like &quot;A GUID cannot contain the character '~'. A GUID 
should be of the form ...&quot;. This makes the GUID recognizer within the 
semantics even more complex, because it has to handle even more invalid 
possibilities.

I realize that there is probably a good balance between the two 
extremes, but it is not clear to me where that would be. I guess my 
question is, is this purely a trade-off between speed/simplicity and 
error handling, or am I missing something that would allow one to get 
the best of both worlds?

Thanks,

- Justin
