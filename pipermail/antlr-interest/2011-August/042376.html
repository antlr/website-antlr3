<PRE>Hi Chris,

 

I got rid of the use of Stack&lt;T&gt; and the call to ElementAt() quite a while
back. Instead I use a ListStack&lt;T&gt; which derives from List&lt;T&gt; and adds Push
and Pop methods. I recommend updating to ANTLR 3.4.1 to correct this issue.

 

Sam

Sam, hey, so I might have bumped into a code gen bug. I'm trying to access a
variable &quot;skipSection&quot; on the parent production of &quot;pp_conditional&quot;. It
looks like the generated code is doing some computation involving the stack
count when really it should just pass my index without any calculation. For
example, below, shouldn't the highlighted code simply be my index? Or am I
missing something? Looks like the highlighted code is assuming TOS is Count
- 1 (like it would be with a stack implemented with a List&lt;T&gt;) but I don't
think that's the case. The stack is a System.Collections.Generic.Stack&lt;T&gt;
which maintains that TOS is always index 0. 

 

$pp_conditional[1]::skipSection

 

The code above is transformed to:

 

System.Linq.Enumerable.ElementAt(pp_conditional_stack,
pp_conditional_stack.Count-1-1).skipSection;

 

Also, you may want to ensure that all user expressions are enclosed in
parens. As I was trying to work around this issue I used &quot;count -2&quot; which
got translated to stack.Count-count -2 -1. I had to add the parens to get it
to be stack.Count-(count -2) -1.

 

Thanks,

Chris

Ok. Thanks for looking into it.

I did, and I can repro the issue but I haven't resolved it yet.

Awesome! I'll give it try. Did you see my follow up email that the parse
string is 5 characters (there is a trailing space)? &quot;/**/ &quot; 

 

And again, love the tool chain. I only really started to get traction on my
project after I installed it. It's working great.

 

Thanks,
Chris

Hi Chris,

In build 3.4.1.9004 that I released today, I switched all the projects to
using $(ProjectDir) with relative paths.

Sam, hey, hope this finds you. Very small suggestion follows :). In
Antlr3.StringTemplate.csproj could you use


&lt;AntlrBuildTaskPath&gt;$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\..\bin\Bootstrap&lt;/AntlrBuildT
askPath&gt;

to reference the bootstrap directory? Originally it used the solutionDir and
that prevented me from including a subset of the projects in my project (so
I could simply reference them and have all the debugging, pdb, source, etc
just work).

Thanks,
Chris
