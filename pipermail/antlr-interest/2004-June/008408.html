</I>I would want to.  I think I added about 40 imaginary tokens to a SQL 
parser I recently did.  Syntactic predicates cost time when tree 
walking.  The idea is to make the tree easy to walk.

</I>&gt;<i> this a common issue? I believe that for any grammar, if you stripped 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> punctuations, it would lead to some or lot of non-determinisms. What's 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> usual way of handling this?
</I>
Two ways.  First is to use &quot;root&quot;ing appropriately to group things that 
belong together.  Sometimes I root with punctuation itself, like 
rooting with LPAREN, then dropping the RPAREN, which is implied by the 
end of the children of LPAREN.

Second is to root with imaginary nodes.  Like #(STATEMENT ...) which 
would imply the semicolon at the end of the statement's children.

Then sometimes you make the tree structure very regular to imply 
punctuation.  C's &quot;for&quot; construct allows empty loops like for (;;) -- 
remove the semicolons and then if there is only one expression in there 
you don't now if it is first, second or third.  So instead i use a NONE 
placeholder inserted by the parser.  Then my tree rule is like #(FOR 
expr expr expr) and one of expr's alts is NONE.

Plenty of examples are in my GCC grammar.
