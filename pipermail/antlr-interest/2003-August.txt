Subject: [antlr-interest] AST construction problem??
Message-ID: <bgefca+o43f@eGroups.com>

Hi,

In order to be familiar with AST construction, I did some small tests 
by usning ANTLR 2.7.2. I realized that ANTLR 2.7.2 can't generate code
(in CPP or Java) correctly, but ANTLR 2.7.1 can. I don't know if I do 
it in a wrong way or ANTLR 2.7.2 has a bug. Would you please point me 
the problem. thanks.

Here is the problem, I modified grammar of exprAST which exists 
in "examples" directory of ANTLR. I use manual tree construction for 
the rule instead of automatic one.

options {
  ...
  buildAST=true;
  ...
}

//original one
//expr : 
//	assignExpr EOF! 
//     ; 

expr! : 
	assignExpr EOF! 
	{#expr = #(assignExpr, EOF);}
	;

When I'm trying to comile the generated codes, compiler generate the 
following error:
ExprParser.cpp(55) : error C2065: 'tmp1_AST' : undeclared identifier

after read the generated code and compared with code generated by 
antlr2.7.1, I realized that there are missing line 2 and 3 in the 
code which is generated by antlr2.7.2, temp1_AST is the node to 
represent EOF.  

//snip c++ code generated by antlr2.7.1
1: assignExpr();
2: ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)RefAST tmp1_AST = ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE
(antlr)nullAST;
3: tmp1_AST = astFactory.create(LT(1));
4: match(ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)Token::EOF_TYPE);

How can I keep a lexer and a parser in one file, and a tree parser in
another file? If I put them all in one grammar file, then it works,
but when I move the tree parser to another file, I get "unexpected AST
node" errors. Is there some "#include" directive for grammars? Or any
other solution?

Ok, due to popular aclamation, antlraux license is now BSD (in
oposition to the previous GPL). Since I could not simply change the
original sources, I've re-released them under BSD (so now current
version is 0.2.1).

Please feel free to check antlraux official site (http://antlraux.sf.net)

Any comments are very welcome!

Enrique.

thank you, it worked :)
I saw that option before, but I thought it referred to the characters
in the vocabulary..
I was pretty close: it actually refers to tokens, and for lexers
tokens are characters, but I forgot that tokens can be more for parsers :)

afterwards I found out the hard way that modifications in the parser
can lead to changes in token values, which require recompilation of
the separate tree parser.. anyway now I'm making good progress towards
the first quasi-usable alpha version of my C++ source code formatter :)

In the C# library.

I need my tokens to remember the filename but I've just noticed that Token.getFilename and Token.setFilename are not virtual. And even if they were, Token.setFilename is never called
by CharScanner.

Is it ok to implement these changes? Whom should I submit the changes to? I'd rather not have my own private copy of the library...

Thanks again,

Hi!

I had a similar problem when developing my java project (with the
charScanner; all java methods are virtual). Token.setFilename is
neither called from the CharScanner on java mode. After asking in the
forums, the answer I got was that setFilename wasn't invoked "because
your tokens may not come from a file". The answer wasn't Terence's; it
was from an ANTLR user.

This answer did not satisfy me; when I was going to modify ANTLR's
sources, someone pointed that I could override CharScanner::makeToken
(supposing that the java and C# classes use the same method names) and
add the filename in my Lexer. I suppose you could do the same in C#.

Even if the possibility exists, I'd like to see the filename set in
makeToken.

Just my two cents...

Enrique

Funny. And why both the lexer and the parser hold a filename then? Just
because
it's called filename I hope it doesn't mean I'm not allowed to set it to
something
like <script> ou http://foo.bar/test.boo :-)

Due to the '!' on EOF no AST return is generated (the tmp1_AST) if you
remove the !-operator the rule will work. It will also work if you label
teh EOF and use the label like this:

expr! :
 	assignExpr e:EOF!
 	{#expr = #(assignExpr, #e);}
 	;

In this case the labeling of the EOF overwrites the !-operator. Although it
would be nice if antlr gave a warning in such a case. Giving a warning for
the particular case you constructed could be tricky, but I'll see what I
can do.

Cheers,

Ric

Hmm a tab crept in the bit before the ^. To be clear it's the !-operator on
the EOF that's the problem. For the rest see previous reply.

Another thing I missed, you need to label assignExpr as well to be able to
reference it. The doc is a bit fuzzy about it upon rereading it.

expr! :
  	a:assignExpr EOF
  	{#expr = #(a, EOF);}
  	;

Or
expr! :
  	a:assignExpr e:EOF
  	{#expr = #(a, e);}
  	;

Cheers,

Subject: [antlr-interest] Bad exception handling ?
Message-ID: <bgnmo9+qg6m@eGroups.com>

Hi,

I have following problem. I have grammar file with tokens AK, KI, EC 
and ZD. One of parsing rules is:
   (AK)? (KI)? EC (ZD)?
Parsed input stream contains just tokens:
   AK ZD    
(obviously missing EC token)

Relevant part of generated Java parser code to my grammar is as 
follows (for brevity I ommit unnecessary curly braces):

      switch ( LA(1)) {
	case AK:
	        match(AK);
	        break;
	case KI:
	case EC:
		break;
	default:
		throw new NoViableAltException(LT(1), getFilename());
      }
      switch ( LA(1)) {
	case KI:
		match(KI);
		break;
	case EC:
		break;
	default:
!!!		throw new NoViableAltException(LT(1), getFilename());
      }
      match(EC);
   
During parsing, is in line marked by !!! thrown NoViableAltException, 
because in the stream is not the EC token present. 
But the parser just print error message line:xxx:y: unexpected token 
ZD. Thrown exception is caught somewehre inside ANTLR, but I would 
need to have it thrown outside to know that something is wrong in my 
program. I think this exception should be thrown from parser.file() 
method.

Can somebody help me, how to get this exception out of ANTLR and into 
my program where I can handle it and reject such input stream ?

Thanks in advance,
   Julius Siska

Ok, thanks!

I'd anyway recommend this other html code for making the link:

<a href="http://www.antlr.org">
<img src="http://www.antlr.org/images/antlr-link.gif"
 border=0 alt="ANTLR logo"
 width=88 heigth=31></a>

This solves some problems, like borders, etc. Note there can not be
white spaces between the <img ...> and the closing </a>: spaces appear
underlined on links (so there's a 1 space underlined after the logo).

antlraux.sf.net is already showing the logo!

Hi julius.

In my opinion you have two options. The first one consists on turning
off default exception handling. This way your exceptions will make
your parser to stop when an error happens. You can turn default
exception handling off by using the defaultErrorHandler option off
(more information in http://www.antlr.org/doc/options.html#_bb9)

The second option consists in using your own exception handler for
that rule. In the exception handler's code, you should arrange it for
aborting the parsing. There are lots of ways for doing this, one of
them being launching your own exception (i'd recommend a subclass of
java.lang.RuntimeException).

For example, let's imagine that you've implemented a subclass of
RuntimeException called MyParsingException. Then in your rule you'd
have to write:

rule: (AK)? (KI)? EC (ZD)? ;
exception catch [RecognitionException re]
{
 throw new MyParsingException(
  "Error while parsing the source: "+re.getMessage() );
}

You should use this solution if you only want to abort parsing on this
rule, an not on the others.

Cheers,

Enrique

Hi,

Has anyone written a source-level expression optimizer with ANTLR?. 
Even a basic one that optimizes boolean expressions only would be 
fine. The real objective is learning about TreeParser transformations.

Subject: [antlr-interest] The match rule c++ grammar define preproc directives
Message-ID: <003201c35b77$d1f24fe0$ce7c0b50@pbasoftserv02>

Hi , Im investigating c++ grammar enhancements to handle preprocessor
#define directives
everything works well when the define directive has no parameter (tricky but
works smooth )

Now the next thing is handling define arguments :
It appears that arguments can be can be of almost any kind , say :

#define TEST(a,b) a \
                               b

int s(int a,int b){return a+b;}

void theTest()
{
 TEST(\
  int s = \
\
  ::s(0,1);,
    const char *_1 = "we have to handle it";
  )

   TEST( int (*S)(int,int) = ::s; , const char *_2 = "we have to handle it
too"; )

}

must both (amo ) be handled coreectly .

The most straightforward  solution seems the is to use in that case
a second lexer : it has to handle any character until  the next COMMA
or RPAREN is encountered provided that COMMA is not within a LPRAREN RPAREN
statement
and the RPAREN is not a LPAREN match :

How should the rule be written ?

TIA

And because intellisense like features in an ide requires this

code_snippet :
 (
  LPAREN ()* RPAREN
 )
 | ~( ',' | RPAREN )
 )*

code_snippet_list! :
 code_snippet (COMMA code_snippet)*
 ;

CODE_SNIPPETS
 :
 LPAREN! (code_snippet_list)? RPAREN!
 ;

Im not sure that the ()* statement is correct
The scond lexer will feed in the define handler with any relevant char
Any comment is welcome !

handling #if #elseif #endif statement will be the final step here with c++
preprocessing .

Gang,

 From this faq entry of javacc:

http://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/JavaCC-FAQ/javacc-faq.htm#tth_sEc4.7

it appears that once you go k>1 then it does not do checking for you.  
That would make sense it's hard to do in a nonexponential way ;)

Can anybody comment?

We could check to see if Ian would be interested in adding to his 
comments on ANTLR (I think his original comments should be preserved 
along with the dates and not just replaced). Perhaps on the ANTLR 
site too?

I am keen to hear his current opinion about the utility of ANTLR tree 
construction with C++ (and any other language he uses). 

Can you can tell I'm still reading up on TreeParsers?  ;-)

Cheers,

Micheal

Subject: [antlr-interest] 2.7.1 -> 2.7.2 gotcha's?
Message-ID: <bgou1u+ih6k@eGroups.com>

I've had alot of trouble  going from 2.7.1 to 2.7.2

I've found two problems
1.  The grammar file now must specify fully qualified
    names for AST contruction
    i.e.
     Previously we have production rules
    <AST=IdentifierAST>
 
     We must now use
     <AST=mokan.compiler.expr.IdentifierAST>
 
     since the class value is passed as string to
     the constructor function.
 
2.   AST nodes must have public constructors
     otherwise the reflection contructor cannot
     find it in the class file.
 
      Make sure all your AST nodes have
      i.e.
      2.7.1
      protected VarAST(final Token token)
      2.7.2
      public VarAST(final Token token)


Finally, the tree seems to be constructed differently.
A previously working translator now fails completely
with type cast errors, during the tree-walk.


Is there a document describing what has changed and
how to fix these problems???

Thx.

It's not so simple. This technic is based on the fact that you upload your(s)
file(s) on the antlr site. But It's not say. 

I attented to use this for my work (called ABTools) and in the field path, I
give a link to my website (www.chez.com/abtools) and this don't work.
You can test the result on the ANTLR Website.

I think you can add some explanations for describe what you want on the antlr
website.
 

I don't understand why you lost all informations that you capture in the last
ANTLR website (example and all work based on ANTLR).

I fixed it a while ago I believe.  Try again.  You forgot http:// on 
the front.  It has to be a valid URL :)

I guess people should upload any grammar they have that others would 
find useful.

I got tired to re-entering the information and decided that others 
could add pointers to their work themselves.  Also, I removed access to 
some out-of-date work etc...

Howdy.  I am teaching a master's project class at USF this semester and 
am going to offer to direct a project involving ANTLR.  Can people 
suggest a bite-size semester-long project that a group of students 
could do?  I'm thinking that Loring Craymer will suggest a start on the 
ANTLR IDE "workbench" that would display syntax diagrams from grammars 
and perhaps highlight grammar ambiguities.

Beyond making a few project suggestions, does anybody out there want to 
help direct one of the projects?  It would be a loose confederation 
where you could be as involved as you want.  Anything from some initial 
phone conference calls (or showing up if you are around san francisco) 
to actually taking an active role in guiding a project.

Thanks,
Terence

Yes I wrote one as apart of a Algorithmic Differentiation package for GAUSS.

Basically you walk the tree and when you find a + operator for example you
call

 AST result = astPlus(AST lh, AST rh);   to optimize it

Looking at my code

from the calc.g  example   (slightly modified)

 : #(PLUS a:expr b:expr) {
   ## = astPlus(#a, #b);   // process the +
  }


You may not need to use scope for simple optimizations.
If you do I would suggest the anltraux package http://antlraux.sf.net
hope this helps

NetBeans already supports using ANTLR for grammar highlighting so I would
suggest starting there for IDE's (ie. use ANTLR to parse ANTLR).
However, having looked at it myself you may need half your time just sorting
out how the current implementation works.

I was thinking the same thing about the eclipse plugin.  What I'd 
really like is a prototyping tool that made it super easy to create a 
parser or translator rapidly.  Later people could import the grammar 
into eclipse or whatever.

 I think, its a good idea, but you can take into account the possibility to
construct a new grammar by inehritance and add some facilities for distinguishes
 new ambiguities introduces by new rules or by overloading rules.

 One another thing is to facilitate the manual tree construction based on
predifined grammar token (importVocab).

Thanks...yes support for tree building and inheritance would be useful.

Terence

I like the page. Most of my initial compilers/interpreters (circa 1991)
were of the hand-crafted recursive descent variety too, which I guess
explains why ANTLR feels fairly natural to me (vs tools like lex+yacc).

I would suggest adding a paragraph that emphasises a) the near
homogeneity of lexer, parser, and tree walker notations, and b) the
utility of AST generation and walking for, among other things,
separating front ends (language grammars) from back-ends (code
generation etc), and as a useful intermediate language for interpreters.

I notice that support for Sather generation has gone away (according to
this page). Just a lack of demand? I never used it so it doesn't bother
me. Just curious. I've yet to make the transtion to 2.7.2.

Thanks for a great tool BTW. I have used it for Masters thesis and
industry work for about four years now.

Rgds,

The author didn't want to support any more and almost nobody used it ;)

Cool. :)  Perhaps you'd add a testimonial to the site? ;)

I am still chasing it down.   I am using 
an extended java parser (java.g) from a few
years ago (I inherited the code).  

I've looked for ASTFrame and can't find
it.

Hello,

 I work on a formal language called "B" (developped by J.R. Abrial) which based
on some formal sub-language such 
 a. First order logic  and set theory
 b. Substitution (Dijkstra)

 For modelize it, I created 
 1. a first grammar called expression which contains first order logic and set
theory (defined exportVocab).
 2. a second grammar called B which defined the B language and inherited the
first grammar (use importVocab).


In my makefile i passed the argument -glib "expression.g" to antlr tools and all
work fine.

 Questions: 
 a. Why the iniherited information is done two (in grammar file and in command
line)? 
 b. Is not possible to simplify this ?
 c. When you inherited why the Java code in headfile is not inherited ? (I copy
this but it's not a good solution).


 I purposed some extension for B language and described a third language Bprime
which inherited grammar B.

 But I have BPrime that inherite B and B that inherite Expression. I can't give
two file in Antlr tool command line (-glib "expression.g" -glib "B.g doesn't
work) and I have some errors.

 Why isn't possible to describe a language which is based on many iheritance ?

Message-ID: <51DF4D0F94E1D511AE9A00508BDF80A2020A6EA8@nlurm00ntms001.urm03.dsm-group.com>

Hi,

I've got the following code snippet in my tree walker source file:

[Start of code snippet]
expr
	: id:ID
	  {
	     // Several actions....
        }
	| IntConst
	| DoubleConst
	| #( . expr expr)
	;
[End of code snippet]

Running this through antlr 2.7.2 the following code is generated:
[Start of generated code]
void BuilderWalker::expr(ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)RefAST _t) {
	ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)RefAST expr_AST_in = _t;
	ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)RefAST id =
ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)nullAST;
	
	try {      // for error handling
		if (_t == ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)nullAST )
			_t = ASTNULL;
		if ((_t->getType() == ID)) {
			id = _t;
			match(_t,ID);
			_t = _t->getNextSibling();
			
// Several actions
				
		}
		else if ((_t->getType() == IntConst)) {
			ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)RefAST tmp2_AST_in = _t;
			match(_t,IntConst);
			_t = _t->getNextSibling();
		}
		else if ((_t->getType() == DoubleConst)) {
			ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)RefAST tmp3_AST_in = _t;
			match(_t,DoubleConst);
			_t = _t->getNextSibling();
		}
		else if (((_t->getType() >= Vocabulary && _t->getType() <=
IntConst))) {
			ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)RefAST __t4 = _t;
			ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)RefAST tmp4_AST_in = _t;
			if ( _t == ASTNULL ) throw
MismatchedTokenException(); // !!!! Error message !!!!
			_t = _t->getFirstChild();
			expr(_t);
			_t = _retTree;
			expr(_t);
			_t = _retTree;
			_t = __t4;
			_t = _t->getNextSibling();
		}
		else {
			throw
ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)NoViableAltException(_t);
		}
		
	}
	catch (ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)RecognitionException& ex) {
		reportError(ex);
		if ( _t != ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)nullAST )
			_t = _t->getNextSibling();
	}
	_retTree = _t;
}
[End of generated code]

And on compilation the following error message is generated (on the line
indicated above):
[Start of error message]
Call to undefined function 'MismatchedTokenException'
[End of error message]

Could someone please tell me what's wrong with my code ?

I have a queer feeling something's wrong with our code ;)

Is the problem solved if you add ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr) in front of the
MismatchedTokenException ?

I'll probably roll a new snapshot later today including this fix.

Subject: [antlr-interest] suggested ANTLR projects?


Howdy.  I am teaching a master's project class at USF this semester and 
am going to offer to direct a project involving ANTLR.  Can people 
suggest a bite-size semester-long project that a group of students 
could do?  I'm thinking that Loring Craymer will suggest a start on the 
ANTLR IDE "workbench" that would display syntax diagrams from grammars 
and perhaps highlight grammar ambiguities.

Beyond making a few project suggestions, does anybody out there want to 
help direct one of the projects?  It would be a loose confederation 
where you could be as involved as you want.  Anything from some initial 
phone conference calls (or showing up if you are around san francisco) 
to actually taking an active role in guiding a project.

Thanks,
Terence

Subject: [antlr-interest] Is this a bug in Antlr?
Message-ID: <3F326198.21995.B8412D0@localhost>

I have a problem parsing a grammar, and it looks to me as though it 
may be a bug in Antlr, but then again maybe I'm just missing 
something obvious. I've cut the problem down to a (nearly) minimal 
grammar attached below.

Compile and run using:
   java antlr.Tool grammar.g
   csc GrammarTokenTypes.cs Grammar.cs /R:antlr.runtime.dll
   Grammar.exe

The output from the program is:
line 0:0: unexpected token [")",<5>,line=0,col=0]

The output I would expect from the program is:
 ( a )

I can get the expected output in a number of ways, e.g. removing 
either branch of the (unused) 'list_iter' rule, using the commented 
out line under the 'factor' rule instead of the current line. Any of 
these minor changes make the parser work the way I expect, but with 
the grammar as given below, the parser seems determined that an 
'expr' can never be followed by a ')'.

Any suggestions how to get this to parse the way I expect without 
breaking the grammar?

I recommend using the -traceParser option when invoking antlr.Tool to see
what is going on.  Also read through the generated code and see which test
is failing and throwing that exception.  That may give us a clue.

Hello everybody,
I am performing an open test of my MS SQL parser.
It is simple. If you have any complicated or unusual "select" 
statement just browse to:
http://jastrzebski.europe.webmatrixhosting.net/mssqlparser.aspx
, paste your statement into the textbox, press the "parse" button and 
see results.

All parse errors are being logged which will help me to improve my

Thanks in advance for your help.

I've run a quick test of few queries.
The longest one I could find that I use caused parse error, but I could
reduce it to a small example:
select * from item where createdOn between {ts '2001-08-07 14:43:32'} and
{ts '2003-08-07 14:43:32'}

it doesn't seem to parse time/date values of this format, but when I tried
putting invalid date/time (by mistake)
select * from item where createdOn between #start_date# and #end_date# it
parsed it fine.

When I removed the {ts from the query it run fine. I have some more
complicated queries that I will test.

Are you going to make the grammar file available? I would be really
interested in using one.

Ok, I just wanted to be sure it wasn't something stupid before I posted too 
much information.

The problem is that it is throwning NoViableAltException in the method 
'factor'. Output with -traceParser:

     > expr; LA(1)==(, LA(2)==a
      > term; LA(1)==(, LA(2)==a
       > factor; LA(1)==(, LA(2)==a

            < atom; LA(1)==), LA(2)==
    
    Unhandled Exception: line 0:0: unexpected token: [")",<5>,line=0,col=0]
           < factor; LA(1)==), LA(2)==
          < term; LA(1)==), LA(2)==
         < expr; LA(1)==), LA(2)==
        < atom; LA(1)==), LA(2)==
       < factor; LA(1)==), LA(2)==
      < term; LA(1)==), LA(2)==
     < expr; LA(1)==), LA(2)==
    
And the factor method looks like:

 public void factor() //throws RecognitionException, TokenStreamException
 {

     traceIn("factor");
     try { // debugging
         returnAST = null;
         ASTPair currentAST = new ASTPair();
         AST factor_AST = null;

         atom();
         astFactory.addASTChild(currentAST, returnAST);
         {
             switch ( LA(1) )
             {
             case LPAR:
             {
                 trailer();
                 astFactory.addASTChild(currentAST, returnAST);
                 break;
             }
             case EOF:
             case 6:
             case 7:
             case 8:
             case 9:
             {
                 break;
             }
             default:
             {
                 throw new NoViableAltException(LT(1), getFilename());
             }
             }
         }
         factor_AST = currentAST.root;
         returnAST = factor_AST;
     }
     finally
     { // debugging
         traceOut("factor");
     }
 }

Also GrammarTokenTypes:
// $ANTLR 2.7.2: grammar.g -> GrammarTokenTypes.txt$
Grammar    // output token vocab name
LPAR="("=4
RPAR=")"=5
"+"=6
"-"=7
"*"=8
"/"=9
NAME=10
NUMBER=11
LITERAL_for="for"=12
LITERAL_in="in"=13
LITERAL_if="if"=14

When I make a minor change to the grammar, such as commenting out the line 
"list_for |" in list_iter, I get this in the middle of factor:

             case EOF:
             case RPAR:
             case 6:
             case 7:
             case 8:
             case 9:
             {
                 break;
             }

which is what I would have expected.

Don't try DLL builds with vanilla 2.7.2 and MSVC 6. You can try the latest
development snapshot from:

http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr/

It will probably still not work for a DLL build on MSVC6 but MSVC7 is
reported to work. For workspace creation read lib/cpp/README.

Cheers,

Ric

You started from an empty workspace ? Gah I now see that I still had the
old MSVC projects in contrib, could have sworn I had deleted those.

Start with an empty project Win32 static library, Enable Run-Time Type Info
add all the CPP files from the lib/cpp/src directory except the dll.cpp.
Add lib/cpp to your include path. (might need full path for the latter)
After that things should compile. Also for the ADA parser add the lib/cpp
directory to the searchpath for include files.

Cheers,

Ric

Subject: [antlr-interest] Error including SemanticException.cpp
Message-ID: <bh0h3c+hleg@eGroups.com>

Hi,

 I am encountering the following error when I use antlr with VC++6.0:

error C2039: 'SemanticException' : is not a member of 'antlr'
error C2065: 'SemanticException' : undeclared identifier
error C2039: 'SemanticException' : is not a member of 'antlr'

It all works fine if I manually include SemanticException.hpp in my 
lexer.hpp file. I had a feeling it should compile fine without having 
to make changes to any of the generated files. Is there something 
else I'm missing?

thanks,
Ananth

Hi,

I develop one large project and one of must have features of this
project is ability to write in curly braces "{", "}" some non java
language and generate java code based on this language. I know how to
do this except one thing (I hope so). 

I need to do some initialization for my language and best place to do
this is in lexer, parser or tree parser class constructor. I try to
determine in source where constructor is generated but even with
extensive debuging session for me this hapen to be mission imposible.
Can somebody explain me where in ANTLR class constructor is generated.

Hi Jim (and others that responded).

Sounds like Monty has offered to "manage" the IDE project prototype 
this Fall and he makes the most sense I'd say.  I might be doing 
another project next semester though ;)

Also, I'm going to see if I can get students to build grammars.  Can 
people suggest grammars they want built?  They might have to describe 
it to the students. ;)

I'm also going to ask a studnet to help finish the antlr.org site. :)

Another way it's that yours students contributes at some project. I can, for
example, purpose that somes students write some treewalker:
 1. a code generator (from B to JAVA),
 2. a code generator (from B to C),
 3. a Proof Obligation Genarator;
for my project ABTools. 

In this case, I can give initial grammar for the B language and the
specification of tree transformation.

A grammar that does type checking would be helpful, as would one that does
better than average error messages.  They could be the same grammar.  In
fact they could be extensions to the gcc grammar <wink>.  C is just a bit
hairier than Java in the type department so is more interesting.

That is true.  I can make a list of these projects and grammars and see 
which the students pick to work on.  I'm afraid building grammars and 
such won't be very interesting to the students. :(

Another way it's that yours students contributes at some project. I can, for
example, purpose that somes students write some treewalker:
 1. a code generator (from B to JAVA),
 2. a code generator (from B to C),
 3. a Proof Obligation Genarator;
for my project ABTools.

In this case, I can give initial grammar for the B language and the
specification of tree transformation.

Subject: [antlr-interest] string interpolation
Message-ID: <Sea1-DAV33k80TBJ6Z70001d5d7@hotmail.com>

I'm building a very simple parser that recognizes (and interprets) simple programs such as:

    a = 5+3
    b = 102-5
    print "a: ${a}, b: ${b}, a+b: ${a+b}"

The main thing I'm trying to achieve with this toy is to get the string interpolation thing right before integrating it in a larger parser project I'm working on.

The SI thing works by transforming expressions such as:

    "a+b: ${a+b}, b: ${b}"

in:

    "a+b: {0}, b: {1}" a + b ESEPARATOR b

before they get to the parser (ESEPARATOR is an imaginary token).

I have successfully put the parser to work by combining two lexers, a TokenStreamSelector along with a custom TokenStream implementation (TokenStreamRecorder).

My problem now is to make sure the lexer rejects invalid sequences such as:
        
       "${ ${}"

       "${"

       "${

with a SemanticException. Unfortunately the exception is not getting through...

I have already set the defaultErrorHandler to false in the parser and in both lexers.

The grammar for the second lexer (the one parsing the expression inside ${}) follows:
<grammar>
options
{
 language="CSharp";
}
class ExpressionLexer extends Lexer;
options
{
 importVocab = SI;
 defaultErrorHandler=false;
}
{
 public override void uponEOF()
 {
  // should never see EOF
  Error();
 }

 void Error()
 {
  throw new SemanticException(
   "Invalid expression!",
   getFilename(),
   getLine(),
   getColumn()
   );
 }
}
ID: ID_LETTER (ID_LETTER | DIGIT)*;

INT: (DIGIT)+;

ASSIGN: '=';

SUM_OPERATOR : '+' | '-' ;

WS: (' ' | '\t' | '\r' | '\n' { newline(); }) { $setType(Token.SKIP); };

RBRACE: '}';

DQ: '"' { Error(); };
 
protected
ID_LETTER : ('_' | 'a'..'z' | 'A'..'Z' );

protected
DIGIT : '0'..'9';
</grammar>

I can send the other 2 files (the main grammar file and the custom TokenStream implementation) if someone is willing to take a look at them also...

BTW, I'll post the whole project to the antlr site upon completion, I think it's a good example of how to combine TokenStreamSelector with custom TokenStream implementations...

Thanks in advance for any help,
Rodrigo

I've just found this code in the TokenStreamSelector class:

<snip src="TokenStreamSelector.cs">
  public virtual Token nextToken()
  {
   // return input.nextToken();
   // keep looking for a token until you don't
   // get a retry exception.
    for (; ; )
   {
    try
    {
     return input.nextToken();
    }
    //catch (TokenStreamRetryException r)
    catch
    {
     // just retry "forever"
    }
   }
  }
</snip>

The java version of the method catches TokenStreamRetryException only. Is there any special reason why the C# version is not doing the same?

Uncommenting the catch (TokenStreamRetryException) solves my problem.

BTW, this is the second change I apply to my private copy of the C# runtime library... Whom I can send them to?

One pet grammar of mine is that of the international date and time
format ISO 8601:2000.  Most people will have come across dates such
as 2003-08-12 but the standard covers many other formats.  A summary
can be found at
http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/popstds/datesandtime.html

A final draft of the standard can be found via
http://www.qsl.net/g1smd/temp/PDF_Links.html

Here is a summary of the grammar that might form the basis of a parser.
The goal ought to be to recognize all the examples in the standard.

5 Representations
5.1 Explanations
5.1.1 Characters used in place of digits or signs: YMDwhmsn+
   [+ should be plus_or_minus]
5.1.2 Characters used as designators: PRTWZDHMS

4.4 The space character shall not be used in the representations
   [but a common misuse of ISO8601 uses space instead of T]
   Lower case characters may be substituted for upper case
4.5 Characters used as separators: -:/#,.

5.3.1.5 Representation with time designator
   If the time of the day is represented in basic format in a context that does
   not clearly identify a time only expression, the time designator [T] 
shall be
   used immediately in front of the presentations defined in 5.3.1.1 through
   5.3.1.3.
5.3.2 Midnight
   In 5.3.1.* hh is either 00 or 24 and mm is 00.

5.4.2 Representations other than complete
5.2.* plus T plus 5.3.4.2
   provided that
   a) the rules specified in those sections are applied;
   b) the resulting expression does not qualify as a complete representation in
      accordance with 5.4.1;
   c) the date component shall not be represented with reduced precision 
and the
      time component shall not be truncated. Note that this excludes the date
      representations in 5.2.1.3 and 5.2.3.3 that are truncated and reduced and
      the date representations in 5.2.1.4 and 5.2.3.4 that are expanded and
      reduced;
   d) the expression shall either be completely in basic format, in which case
      the minimum number of separators necessary for the required expression is
      used, or completely in extended format, in which case additional 
separators
      shall be used in accordance with 5.2 and 5.3.
5.5 Time-intervals
5.5.1 Means of specifying time-intervals
   A time-interval shall be expressed in one of the following ways:
   a) by a start and an end;
   b) by a duration not associated with any start or end;
   c) by a start and a duration;
   d) by a duration and an end.
5.5.2 Separators and designators
   A time interval is expressed according to the following rules:
   a) a solidus [/] shall be used to separate the two components in each of 
5.5.1
      a), c) and d).
   b) for 5.5.1 b), c) and d) the designator [P] shall precede, without spaces,
      the representation of the duration.
   c) other designators (and the hyphen when used to indicate omitted 
components)
      shall be used as shown in 5.5.4 and 5.5.5 below.
   NOTE In certain application areas a double hyphen is used as a separator
      instead of a solidus.
5.5.3 Representation of duration
5.5.3.1 Format with time-unit designators
   In expressions of time-interval or recurring time-interval duration can be
   represented by a data element using time unit designators. The number of 
years
   shall be followed by the designator [Y], the number of months by [M], the
   number of weeks by [W], and the number of days by [D]. The part 
including time
   components shall be preceded by the designator [T]; the number of hours 
shall
   be followed by [H], the number of minutes by [M] and the number of 
seconds by
   [S]. In the examples [n] represents one or more digits, constituting a
   positive integer or zero.

   In basic and extended format the complete representation for duration 
shall be
   nYnMnDTnHnMnS or nW.

   For reduced precision, decimal or truncated representations of this 
format the
   following rules apply.
   a) If necessary for a particular application the lowest order components may
      be omitted to represent duration with reduced precision.
   b) If necessary for a particular application the lowest order component may
      have a decimal fraction. The decimal fraction shall be divided from the
      integer part by the decimal sign specified in ISO 31-0: i.e. the 
comma [,]
      or full stop [.]. Of these, the comma is the preferred sign. The decimal
      fraction shall at least have one digit. If the magnitude of the number is
      less than unity, the decimal sign shall be preceded by a zero (see ISO
      31-0).
   c) If the number of years, months, days, hours, minutes or seconds in any of
      these expressions equals zero, the number and the corresponding 
designator
      may be absent; however, at least one number and its designator shall be
      present. Note that the removal of leading non-zero components is not
      allowed.
   d) The designator T shall be absent if all of the time components are 
absent.
5.5.3.2 Alternative format (optional)
5.5.4 Complete representations
5.5.4.1 Representation of time-intervals identified by start and end
5.4.1.* / 5.4.1.*

5.5.4.3 Representation of time-interval identified by its start and its 
duration
5.5.4.3.B: 5.4.1.*.B / 5.5.3.*.B
5.5.4.3.E: 5.4.1.*.E / 5.5.3.*.E
5.5.4.4 Representation of time-interval identified by its duration and its end
5.5.4.4.B: 5.5.3.*.B / 5.4.1.*.B
5.5.4.4.E: 5.5.3.*.E / 5.4.1.*.E
5.5.5 Representations other than complete
   A representation other than complete of a time-interval shall be an 
expression
   in accordance with 5.5.1 and 5.5.2, where time-points are represented in
   accordance with 5.2, 5.3 or 5.4 and where duration is represented in
   accordance with 5.5.3.1 or 5.5.3.2, provided that:
   a) the rules specified in those sections are applied;
   b) the result is not a complete representation in accordance with 5.5.4, and
   c) for which the resulting expression is either consistently in basic format
      or consistently in extended format;
   d) the use of a representation needs to be agreed by the partners in
      information interchange, if the use of any of its constituent parts needs
      to be agreed by the partners in information interchange.
   In the representation of time-intervals in accordance with 5.5.1 a),
   - if higher order components are omitted from the expression following the
     solidus (i.e. the representation for "end of time-interval"), it shall be
     assumed that the corresponding components from the "start of 
time-interval"
     expression apply (e.g. if [YYYYMM] are omitted by using a derived
     representation, the end of the time-interval is in the same year and month
     as the start of the time-interval);
   - representations for time-zones and Coordinated Universal Time included 
with
     the component preceding the solidus shall be assumed to apply to the
     component following the solidus, unless a corresponding alternative is
     included.
5.6 Recurring time-intervals
5.6.1 Means of specifying recurring time-intervals
   A recurring time-interval shall be expressed in one of the following ways:
   a) By a number of recurrences (optional), a start and an end. This 
represents
      a recurring time-interval of which the first time-interval is 
identified by
      the first two components of the expression and the number of 
recurrences by
      the last component. If the last component is absent the number of
      occurrences is unbounded.
   b) By a number of recurrences (optional) and a duration. This represents a
      recurring time interval with the indicated duration for each 
time-interval
      and with the indicated number of recurrences. If the number of 
recurrences
      is absent the number of occurrences is unbounded.
   c) By a number of recurrences (optional) a start and a duration. This
      represents a recurring time-interval of which the first time-interval is
      identified by the first two components of the expression and the 
number of
      recurrences by the last component. If the last component is absent the
      number of occurrences is unbounded.
   d) By a number of recurrences (optional), a duration and an end. This
      represents a recurring time-interval of which the last time-interval is
      identified by the first two components of the expression and the 
number of
      recurrences by the last component. If the last component is absent the
      number of occurrences is unbounded.
5.6.2 Separators and designators
   All representations start with the designator [R], followed, without spaces,
   by the number of recurrences, if present, followed, without spaces, by a
   solidus [ /], followed, without spaces, by the expression of a time interval
   in accordance with 5.5.1. For the representation 5.6.1 a), 5.6.1 b), 
5.6.1 c)
   and 5.6.1 d) the time interval in accordance with 5.5.1 a), 5.5.1 b), 
5.5.1 c)
   and 5.5.1 d) shall be used respectively.
5.6.3 Complete representations
5.6.3: Rn / 5.5.*

				else if ((LA(1)=='<') && (LA(2)
=='a')) {
					mQUOTE_HREF(true);
					theRetToken=_returnToken;
				}

How can I get it to to do more than 2 lookahead as it is now picking 
up statement in my code that have < (greater than sign) and some text.

Regards

Colette

I think this is a great project and I would be interested in the results.
Usually I just specify the date format the user can use.

Another small project would be complex number parsing (with good error
messages)
examples include
1
1.0
+1.0
1+i   1+j
1-i    1-j
-i
1-5.0i
j5   (perhaps)
etc
I have tried this without using Antlr and quickly gave up and went back to
Antlr to do the parsing and give useful error messages.
The trick I used for errormessages was to code into the parser some common
errors and parse them to give an explicit error message.
eg
1 5.0i
"missing sign for imaginary part"
1+5
"missing imaginary part - did you forget the 'i' or 'j' "
1j + 2
"real part should be first"      (perhaps this is too strict??)

Message-ID: <60014.81.86.246.43.1060685031.squirrel@webmail.sbu.ac.uk>

For your information.

Whilst testing my latest version of the C++ definition
the following lines found in my copy of token.hpp dated
24 Sept 2000 have given me some grief when they
appeared in support.i because no return type had been
given. It seems clear that this should be "bool".

#ifdef NEEDS_OPERATOR_LESS_THAN
inline operator<(RefToken l,RefToken r); //{return true;}
#endif

I realise that my compiler (MSVC 6) had already accepted
it but perhaps it accepted a default of "int".

However, the C++ standard no longer allows "implicit" int.

It is of course possible that later versions of token.hpp
have been updated.

I would be grateful if someone could confirm that the
return type should be given as "bool".

In the meantime I have updated my copy.

Thanks.

For your information.

With reference to my previous message about token.hpp
the same thing applies to ast.hpp so I have inserted
"bool" between "inline" and "operator" there as well.

Code from ast.hpp.

#ifdef NEEDS_OPERATOR_LESS_THAN
inline operator<(RefAST l,RefAST r); // {return true;}
#endif

As far as the Workbench, I would suggest considering Netbeans rather 
than Eclipse as they have more stuff for that sort of thing until 
(and if) the Harmonia 
(http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~harmonia/harmonia/index.html) 
Eclipseport comes out. Eclipse have, from the brief look at their 
site (don't use it) no support for Editors (I imagine there's support 
for adding them but nothing for making them). Netbeans on the other 
hand have a Lexer module (http://lexer.netbeans.org/) that does 
incremental lexing using an Antlr lexer (interesting in itself). 
There is a syntax colouring bridge that allows for the creation of a 
Swing editor set on top of such a lexer. Which IDE is better is a big 
question, but perhaps Netbeans is better for developing, which is 
important here. There is an Antlr project for Netbeans but it is no 
longer maintained and is out of date with the Netbeans APIs, so would 
pretty much be a rewrite.

As to grammars, I would suggest a rewrite of the Antlr grammar and 
possibly the Antlr tool on top of it. To create a TreeParser and put 
the code generation hooks in that rather than the Parser. This could 
then be built on for Antlr 3, and would be helpful (if not necessary) 
for an Antlr editing tool (if you do high-level analysis, the Antlr 
lexer ain't too bad, and is seperate from the rest, bar the nasty 
options\tokens\actions hack).

Incremental lexing\parsing is another idea. As I said Netbeans have a 
incremental lexer built on top of Netbeans, creating such a framework 
as part of Antlr could be interesting. Incremental lexing ain't that 
hard, in theory, check out some of the articles on the Harmonia site 
for details (e.g. "General incremental lexical analysis" in the 
Ensemble section). In fact the Netbeans support could be improved 
upon, incremental lexing gains from having a way to in effect return 
multiple tokens at a time, to tell the incremental lexer not to try 
an resume in the middle of a token (e.g. in Antlr you want to 
return "options {" as two tokens: LITERAL_options and LCURLY but you 
want to lex it in a single rule) so either non-restartable tokens or 
returning multiple tokens from one lexer rule is desirable, neither 
of which the Netbeans lexer supports. Incremental LL(k) parsing is 
another matter, all the Harmonia stuff is on LR and then you start to 
need a fully fledged versioned document system (see Harmonia stuff, 
not CVS, but a document where each token is versioned to support 
incremental processing) but the theory for incremental LL(k) parsing 
is all there, and so is an implementation using Antlr.

Subject: [antlr-interest] 2.7.1 -> 2.7.2 ASTFactory bug
Message-ID: <1060740171.12888.30.camel@merrimack>


I think there is a bug when using heterogeneous trees
with the new ASTFactory class.

Explanation:
create(Token tok, String className) is called whenever <AST=className>
occurs in the grammar.   The constructor className(Token tok) usually
would set the AST type and possibly the text using setType and setText
to the constructed node.   The 2.7.2  behavior would re-initialize
the newly constructed AST with the token text and type.

The patched version will only initialize the constructed
AST when the default constructor is used (i.e. className() ).
Even this might be considered incorrect.  

An alternate would be to require heterogeneous AST nodes
ignore the "initialize" call.

Please explain why "options {" is better lexed as a single rule? I 
noticed this kind of thing in ANTLR's antlr.g grammar and I simply could 
not understand why the grammar was written like that. I feel I must be 
overlooking something.

I can't remember why anymore but I remember it being a good reason at

I think what we'll probably do is try to get a random prototype thing 
that tests ideas out this semester.  Once we know what the issues and 
such we can take a strategy to get it integrated into the various IDEs. 
  I think this is a proper software "engineering" idea.  Learn about the 
problem and then design a solution ;)

I like the idea of the incremental parsing stuff... Sounds like Spring 
2004's masters project class could have a student work on that. ;)  
I'll be teaching the graduate programming language course again in the 
Spring.

I have a very clean ANTLR grammar parser that generates a tree and I 
have tree parsers that do a variety of things like print it back out 
w/o actions.  I can post this if people would like to check it out.  I 
believe I ignore the options and other stuff, focusing on the grammar 
elements--I'm using it to build the new grammar analysis engine.

Soon I should a very clean and nice full LL(k) analysis engine that 
will be the core of the workbench project. :)  Trying to prep for class 
and work on this at the same time. After 15 years, I believe I 
understand the problem enough now to implement it in a very simple 
manner. ;)

Aside from features and clean up of ideas etc... for ANTLR 3, a HUGE 
motivation is to finally produce a bunch of code I'm proud to have 
people look at.  ANTLR has always been a gawd-awful messy prototype w/o 
rigorous testing facilities and was used as an experimental-ideas 
workhorse for me.  This new version will be written specifically for 
readability, testability, encapsulation, rigor, beauty.  Heck, I've 
already rewritten the analysis part 3 times since May ;)  I'm building 
tests first and then working on the code.

Once the analysis engine is done (the hard part) [yes, johnm with 
hoisting!!], I will focus on writing a whitepaper describing the new 
system and then writing the complete manual.  We'll need people to 
evaluate the functionality, consistency, flexibility etc... and then 
once we all agree it's about right, I'll start from a blank page and 
carefully craft the core system.

I will be focusing a great deal of effort on the code emitters (i.e., 
how you generate parsers) so that making a code generator for a new 
language is really simple.  Part of this focus will be precisely 
defining what a code generator has to do and what the functionality 
must be for tree stuff etc...  There will be multiple levels of 
compliance like generates parsers then handles trees then handles tree 
rewrites etc...  I'm even going to have a serialized text-based form of 
the intermediate representation so that you could, for example, read in 
the intermediate stuff generated by antlr in python and generate python 
parsers w/o ever touching Java (ANTLR's core implementation language).

Anyway, now that I'm back in academia at USF, I'm going to do this 
"right".  No more doing something "fast" instead of "right" because I 
have to finish my thesis or focus on making money ;)

Enough blabbing for now... :)

Message-ID: <bhemg1+roe1@eGroups.com>

Terr was right, there was a good reason. Basically options section, 
tokens section and actions are horribly ambiguous, partly due to the 
opacity of actions. The rules are:
OPTIONS: "options" (WS|COMMENT)* LCURLY; // Same for tokens
ACTION: LCURLY (.*) RCURLY; // With extra stuff to handle RCURLY in 
comment\string literal etc.
So, if you see a LCURLY it's really hard to know what to do. Is it an 
action where you want to swallow everything pretty indescriminantly 
or the start of a tokens\options block where you can actually parse 
what's inside?
The solution used in Antlr is to match "options" (WS|COMMENT)* LCURLY 
in RULEDEF (lowercase starting identifiers).

As Marco says one way to solve it is to use state variables but this 
doesn't work in incremental lexing (at least in the netbeans 
implementation), you need some notion of non-restartable tokens so 
the state is properly updated, e.g. when you change "options" 
to "optios" it needs to relex the following tokens (left to right), 
to pick up what is now an action, when you delete the curly it needs 
to re-lex "options" as a ruleDef not an OPTIONS_BLOCK (left to right) 
etc. So, what you really need to do is recognise it as a single block 
and record 'subtokens' for the various parts. That way the re-lexing 
stuff treats it as one token but you can pull the various parts out. 
Hence you want a way to return multiple tokens from a single rule. Or 
you can make a custom token class to store subtokens, but then you 
have a problem hooking into the incremental lexer. After lexing you 
need to unpack the subtokens for subsequent stuff and then repack 
them back up for the incremental lexer, meaning you need to hookinto 
the lexer. I managed to hack the Netbeans lexer to support non-
restartable tokens and that kinda worked. There was some problem in 
there (incremental and batch lexing was slightly different in a few 
cases) but seemed to get the right stuff.

Ideally you might try and leave it to the parser, but the opacity of 
actions makes that not possible, there can be stuff in an action that 
is not lexable (unless you made a new Antlr lexer for every action 
language).

I did the following (using antlr c++ mode) in the lexer:

NUMBER
	: (DIGIT)+ 
        (H! 
            { 
                string text=$getText;
                int len=atoi(text.c_str());
                $setText("");
                for( int i=0; i<len; i++)
                {
                    consume(); // appends char
                }   
                _ttype=STRING; 
            }
        )?
    ;

I think it should work, but generally I prefer not to call
internals like 'consume()' directly. So is there a way of avoiding
it?
thanks,
marc

You can 'abuse' the initaction of a closure for it. This should work I
think starting at antlr 2.7.1. 2.7.0 placed the initaction outside in front
of the loop which is not very usefull.

NUMBER { size_t n, i = 0; } :
   num:DIGITS
   {
      istringstream s(num->getText());
      s >> n;
   }
   ( 'H'! { $setType(STRING); }
      (
       { // init action gets executed even in guessing mode
          if( i == n )
             break;
          i++;	// count chars here so that guessing mode works
       }:
       CHAR
      )+
   )?
   ;

Cheers,

Ric

This will work, but you are reinventing the wheel. ANTLR has a 
better solution for this: lexer multiplexing. In fact, the problem 
was that the option specification is an embedded language, with a 
different grammar. The "right" solution is to write two lexers that 
call one another when appropriate. Read the documentation and the 
examples from ANTLR distribution for more details. Ter was probably 
too busy and used a quick hack.

BTW, porting the Netbeans approach in ANTLR might not be a good 
idea. They wanted something very general, that works with any parser 
generator, and had to reimplement many features that ANTLR already 
had.

Best regards,
Bogdan

Since you're generating C# code I assume you have the framework installed
and working. That being the case I strongly recommend you to download the
.NET binaries from www.antlr.org and use them instead.

They work great!

Hi Rodrigo!

I did it and it works fine. Are these binaries always synchronised 
with original source?

I think so but the good thing is that you can always build them yourself:

    * for antlr.exe you can download the antlr.2.7.2 J# project from
www.antlr.org
    * for antlr.runtime.dll just invoke nant in the lib/csharp folder of the
distribution and you're set

I wish ANTLR was more stable!

We have been converting the C++ grammar file from use with
PCCTS to use with ANTLR 2.7.1 .

Having parsed support.i, CPPLexer.i and CPPParser.i at last, I
am now trying to get rid of all the unneccesary warnings from
generation of the grammar file using options{greedy = true;}:
and options{warnWhenFollowAmbig = false;}: .

For the former I have five pages of documentation printed from
your website last year. However, I can no longer find anything
about "greedy" on the ANTLR website but have now found a new
one which is options{generateAmbigWarnings = false;}: !

Options "greedy = true" was accepted by ANTLR 2.7.1, but
didn't seem to do anything.

Does it still exist and, if so, what should it do?

Options "warnWhenFollowAmbig = false" seems to work as
described with empty alternatives etc.

Options "generateAmbigWarnings = false" seems to do what I
want for other cases.

Is this equivalent to "#pragma approx" in PCCTS?

Why do we need all these options when "#pragma approx" in
PCCTS seemed to work ok?

Howdy.  greedy is still there.  Perhaps you didn't look at the right 
doc or something...pops right out at you:

http://www.antlr.org/doc/lexer.html#Greedy_Subrules

The various "shut off warnings" are useful for telling antlr a 
particular situation is cool.

#pragma appox was something else entirely, but had the *side* effect of 
generateAmbigWarnings=false.

Hope that helps,
Ter

Hadn't considered multiplexing, but unfortunately I think that 
doesn't help. With mutliplexing, you need a token (well a rule) to 
tell it to kick over to the action lexer. But the problems is with 
distinguishing that token (rule).
Plus, even if that did work you'd have the problem of hooking 
multiplexing into the Netbeans incremental lexer framework, and it 
would be harder (if anything) than hooking in a token stream filter 
(which is how I implemented the subtoken stuff). You'd need to store 
some sort of virtual PUSH_LEXER and POP_LEXER tokens and have the 
incremental lexer handle them when it relexes.
Multiplexing is basically what Antlr does now. OK, it packs all the 
action stuff into a single token, but then it uses the action lexer 
to handle that, so it's not as clean an implementation but same basic 
idea.

Subject: [antlr-interest] saving the token stream
Message-ID: <bhq3ja+9qu3@eGroups.com>

I have a string which is parsed, but in some cases the
last few parsed 'commands' (within the string) must be repeated.
Is there a simple way to save the token stream for this purpose.
Of course I could write a tree parser, but for this relatively simple
issue, I would prefer to reuse the token stream and do all necessary
actions in the parser.
Thanks,
marc

I have achieved something similar with a custom TokenStream implementation
that just records the token it receives for later playback (a
TokenStreamRecorder).

The playback is done with a TokenStreamSelector.push(recorder). When the
TokenStreamRecorder runs out of tokens it just pops
(TokenStreamSelector.pop) to the previous lexer/parser.

I'm gonna post the entire sample to the antlr website later today but I can
email it to you privately if you want. It's C# based but you should have no
problems converting it to java.

Rodrigo

Hi guys,

I remember that 1.5-2 years ago on this list was small discussion about
    HOW TO use ANTLR and parser built with ANTLR

To provide auto-completion feature (like in Visual C++).

Anybody can give some pointers:

1) on this thread (I cannot find it)

2) may be some new description of this task?

3) may be some examples?

4) may be exists some common libs / frameworks that can do this job?


P.S. We want this feature for SQL editor in "Valentina Studio" desktop
database app. User Type something, and editor help him...

Hi All,
  In short, what is the best/easiest/most complete Java Cross Referencer
that you have seen/written/used?

http://home.austin.rr.com/kjohnston/javasrc.htm
http://javasrc.sourceforge.net/
  The ANTLR based Javasrc is very good.  The main limitations are two fold.
You have to have some intrinsic knowledge of the hierarchy of classes to
effectively parse a project ( i.e. the two-pass system).  The other
limitation is that it doesn't support *.class files.  I realize this can be
corrected by "loading" the class into the symbol table beforehand myself.  I
am not averse to using this project.  I wanted to pose the question, "Is
there something more complete and easier?".


http://sourceforge.net/projects/barat
  Barat appears to solve the problems above.  It handles the class files and
needs no ordering of operations.  It is much more difficult to work with.
It is based on JavaCC.  The grammar spits out a java file that must be
compiled using the GJ compiler.

  The ideal solution would  distill the appropriate information from the
jar/class files, parse the *.java files, and resolve the references.  Barat
has a good explanation its "difficulties" with recursively going after
refernced types when parsing a particular class.  I'll stop the specs here.
Any ideas?

I worked for a long time to bastardize the ANTLR-based
refactoring project Transmogrify into doing what I
wanted, but eventually ran across the following set of
articles which basically convinced me that
Transmogrify was not as good a starting point as I
could find:

http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Parser/

I then resolved to study and understand ANTLR before
attempting to tackle this problem.  At one point
Terence was tossing around the idea of having his grad
students implement something similar.  There seems to
be quite a demand for a powerful, versatile, Java
parsing package with AST and symbol table construction
that can be included in an IDE or used otherwise.  I
know Bogdan Mitu and probably others had worked on
incremental lexing/parsing, which would be a handy, if
not essential feature for such a package.  It all
seems like a fairly tall order.

Ter, do you have any comments about the articles I
mentioned above?  I may have asked before but I don't
recall whether the question may have been lost in the
shuffle.

Hi Guys,

At one time, for jGuru, I was building a tool to scarf lots of java 
code and do a serious cross reference.  From that I was going to be 
able to do searches like "find all code related to EJB that also uses 
sockets" or something.  I remember getting the symbol table mostly 
right and the symbol resolution almost right.  The code is unfinished 
and sitting on my disk.

Would love to have someone try to use it as a starting point.  Any 
takers?

Hi.  Auto-completion is not really convenient in the current generated 
output.  It's kind of like compiling C code w/o the symbol table 
information (-g option).  The current ANTLR 3 analysis engine I'm 
working on makes this sort of thing trivial, but of course doesn't 
exist as a tool yet. :(

You might be able to do something interesting with the bitsets used for 
prediction.  These say what tokens predict which alternative.  The 
union of these at any decision point tells you what can come next.  The 
problem is when there is no decision:

a : A B ;

from A to B you make no decision and you would not have sets laying 
around to say "B" can come next.  ON the other hand, you might be able 
to tweak the code generator to dump a bit more info for these single 
token matches.

Still it won't be convenient.  :(

I'm using grammar inheritance and a rule in the sub-grammar is not working 
because it does not test against the tokens defined in the sub-grammar. In 
other words, it appears that the generated code did not take into account 
the tokens defined in the sub-grammar. See example below

File: super.g ------------ANTLR was run against this file first
class superlexer extends lexer;
options { exportVocab = super; }
tokens { FOO="foo"; }
//rules ...
...

class superparser extends parser;
options { exportVocab = super; }
// rules ...
-----------------------------------------
File: sub.g ---------------ANTLR was run against this file second
class sublexer extend superlexer;
options { exportVocab = sub; }
tokens { BAR="bar"; X="x"; Y="y" }
// rules...

class subparser extends superparser;
options { exportVocab = sub; codeGenBitsetTestThreshold=999; }
// rules...
foo_statement: foo_expression BAR;
foo_expression: FOO ( ~(BAR) )*;
-----------------------------------------

Given the input token stream "foo x y bar", the rule "foo_expression" fails 
when it encounters an X or Y reporting that a BAR was expected. Looking at 
the code for foo_expression() it compares LT(1) against every token defined 
in the super grammar but none of the tokens defined in the sub grammar.

Can anyone else verify whether this is a bug or not.

I had similar problems (described in the forum last tuesday). I 'solved'
them by adding the complete token {} section of the parser to the token {}
section of the sub grammar.

Which particular spec of version 3 will cover this? 
Is there an updated spec-in-progress?

I would be interested in a share in this.  Don't think
I have the time and/or expertise to do it all myself
(right).  At the very least I can expect what you've
already got is done well... :)  if we wanted to turn

Subject: [antlr-interest] Question on parsing the loop structure of java.tree.g
Message-ID: <bhrecv+3a3v@eGroups.com>

Hi, I'm using the current java.tree.g which seems not to parse the 
initialization condition of "for" loops correctly.My code looks like 
the following:
for(int i=0,j=0;i<j+1;i++)
{
  //some action
}
The tree walker only walks the first variable "i".
I changed the rule to 
#(FOR_INIT ((variableDef)* | elist)?)
The walk is correct but there is "none-determinism" warning with the 
antlr compilation.
I'm just wondering if this is a bug or something I'm not aware of.

Thanks a lot.

Hello,

 I have the same pb
   A. with a sub-sub-grammar (twice inheritance) and I don't solve this.
   B. and in a grammar with implicite token (token introduce in syntactic rule),
   it's not possible to complete the token part of all grammar.
 
It's a BUG ??

Nope...i'm just working on the engine (throwaway prototype) at the 
moment, but this has led me to believe I can do all sorts of fancy 
tricks later if I simply serialize the grammar/lookahead info (like -g 
option) into the output parser so it's available.  The degenerate case 
might be that I don't generate the parser, just the grammar/lookahead 
info and then you can intepret it. :)

Check the file sharing at the antlr site.  You'll see my tar ball.  
Literally I looked at nothing in there just packaged up (well, I 
removed the package definition statements).

I see my depot having:

     |   #(  "for"
             #(FOR_INIT ((variableDef)+ | elist)?)
             #(FOR_CONDITION (expression)?)
             #(FOR_ITERATOR (elist)?)
             stat
         )

like yours, but with (...)+.  I suspect that I fixed this after 2.7.2 
:) ;)

Thanks,
Terence

Lookahead sets do not capture semantic predicate information used
to predict alternatives.  Perhaps you are thinking of something
like java reflection for grammars ?

Auto-complete features generally use minimal prefix matching to
select the token's interpretation.  Thus, given a choice between
MIN and MAX it will recognize MI as MIN.  This requires feedback
from the parser to the lexer or lazy evaluation of prediction
expressions.

Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLR and GCC
Message-ID: <bhss11+pbdc@eGroups.com>

Hi All,

I am new to ANTLR and I wish to use it with GCC. I have modified the 
backend of GCC compiler to recognise a new architecure which I am 
modelling. I am trying to use ANTLR as a front-end. Is this possible? 
I have written a basic grammar file containing a lexer and parser. I 
am able to compile this with the commands

java antlr.Tool myGrammarFile.g
javac *.java
main    //main is the class name

The last command does not work, i.e no output is produced. (The 
classpath options are set correctly) Should the output be an AST? Am 
i right in thinking that the antlr can output C functions and if so, 
how? Can ANTLR output assembly language?

Maybe I should post this on gcc.gnu.org mailing list but I hope 
somebody on this list may be able to help me. Any ideas/suggestions 
greatly appreciated.

Kind Regards
Roger

Hi Terr,

Sounds cool. 

When you think we will be able start to use this ?

Yes true.

Terr, as I see the task, we need some simple function
That must return LIST / Array of next expected tokens.
 
As tokens we can have

1) simply strings "select"
But I think this will not work because

2) in SQL we can get as next token a FIELD.
So I need self then construct array of field names that exists in my
database.

I.e. I think ANTLR should return me { SELECT_TOKEN, FIELD }
And later I will need just add function

Array<string> BuildStrings( ListOfTokens )
{
    for each token from list

    switch( token )
    {
        case SELECT: res.add( "select" )

        case FIELD: AddFields( res, ... )

        ...
    }
}

Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're trying to make a new frontend to gcc
for a new language and want to use antlr to generate the frontends parser?
If so then technically yes this should be possible. You may have to use a
handmade AST (in plain C datastructures) in stead of the ANTLR supplied
ones, since antlr's support code is all C++. (Or do you want to use gcj to
compile the antlr generated java and use that inside the gcc frontend ??
Would probably also need some wrapper code and some patches to antlr)

Can't say what's happening here too little info.

AFAIK gcc uses some internal intermediate format, you probably need to make
some treewalkers that generate that from the parse tree (AST) generated by
ANTLR.

> Am i right in thinking that the antlr can output C functions and if so,

Antlr generates Java or C# or C++. See the manual as to how (www.antlr.org)

> Can ANTLR output assembly language?

ANTLR itself has no support for writing assembly. But you can make
treeparsers that do. But if you want to interface to gcc you should
probably use their codegenerator tools.

Cheers,

Ric

Hi:

What is the easiest way to ignore sections of a source file?

Say I have a language and all I am interested in, is the text between the token
"feature" and the token "end".

How do I allow anything before feature and after end?

Thanks in advance,

Hi Ruslan,

Well, I'm working like mad on it, but school starts on Monday and so I 
won't have nearly as much time to work on it.  However, I'm hoping that 
by the end of the semester a student will have used my engine to build 
a small prototype workbench for grammars.  Just an experimental thing 
to see what the issues are.  Later we can try to build something to 
integrate into various IDEs.  Anyway, I have mostly finished the parser 
grammar analysis, but am working on a shockingly cool new concept to 
improve the power of ANTLR's parsers that as a side-effect makes the 
lexers much faster and much easier to write while maintaining their 
current power!  yeeeeeehaaaaa!

So, expect to see not a tool, but an analysis engine for ANTLR grammars 
some time this semester.  I'm not sure I'll release it before I have 
tool though, that's the problem.  You see somebody with more time might 
take my engine (the hard part) and build a tool that is out before 
ANTLR 3 can go thru the programmer review process and construction 
process.  I'm telling you folks that this new engine is the most 
obvious and beautiful piece of software imaginable.  The entire LL(k) 
lookahead computation (for full lookahead and ignoring efficiency) is 
one method of about 1.5 pages of code!  It's all in the data structure, 
baby!!!  There is then another few methods for approx lookaehad and 
determinism checking, but this code is clean as hell!  No more 
protection from competition by having opaque code ;)  Heck I even have 
spent days building test harnesses and tests so that I know this sucker 
works :)

Ruslan,

I will try to post my antlr parser and tree walker very soon so that 
you could generate some information yourself to include in your 
parsers.  You could, for example, serialize the grammar with the build 
in AST stuff and then read it back in when you start the parse.  Maybe 
the traceIn/traceOut function could be used to keep a pointer into the 
grammar tree.  When you need what comes next you could simply walk 
forward in the tree looking for the next tokens.  Well, actually that's 
like computing LL(1) lookahead and is not really totally obvious from 
the trees...

Hmm...ok, maybe this won't be that convenient.

Ter

Yeah, that's totally appropriate to put that kind of state in the lexer.  In
fact "lexical states" are probably how you would implement it.

The main thing is to not have feedback from the parser to the lexer.

Wouldn't a solution based on this approach imply
putting state in the Lexer?  Is that good?  I'm asking
because I honestly don't know.

Thanks,

The GCC transformation toolkit http://www.codetransform.com/gcc.html can
output C text from the ASTs generated by my gcc parser.  If your input
language is close to C in structure then you can transform from your AST to
the gcc AST and then use my emitter.  If your language is not really close
to C then you may be better off writing a tree pass that emits C from your
AST.  With more information we can help you sort out what to do.

Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLR and GCC


Hi All,

I am new to ANTLR and I wish to use it with GCC. I have modified the 
backend of GCC compiler to recognise a new architecure which I am 
modelling. I am trying to use ANTLR as a front-end. Is this possible? 
I have written a basic grammar file containing a lexer and parser. I 
am able to compile this with the commands

java antlr.Tool myGrammarFile.g
javac *.java
main    //main is the class name

The last command does not work, i.e no output is produced. (The 
classpath options are set correctly) Should the output be an AST? Am 
i right in thinking that the antlr can output C functions and if so, 
how? Can ANTLR output assembly language?

Maybe I should post this on gcc.gnu.org mailing list but I hope 
somebody on this list may be able to help me. Any ideas/suggestions 
greatly appreciated.

Kind Regards
Roger

Hi Terr,

Sorry for stupid question.
What we can do with this ?

This is pre-view of 3.0 ?
Or we need use this to update 2.7.2 ?

???

Here it is how I did it using the TokenStreamSelector. 

Everything outside the "<'" and "'>" markers is ignored.

header {

options {
    exportVocab=FeatureLexer;
}
{
    TokenStreamSelector selector;
}
// Whitespace -- ignored
WS	:	(	' '

			// handle newlines
		|	(	options {generateAmbigWarnings=false;}
			:	"\r\n"  // Evil DOS
			|	'\r'    // Macintosh
			|	'\n'    // Unix (the right way)
			)
			{ newline(); }
		)+
		{ _ttype = Token.SKIP; }
	;
// Single-line comments
SL_COMMENT
	:	"//"
		(~('\n'|'\r'))* ('\n'|'\r'('\n')?)
		{$setType(Token.SKIP); newline();}
	;
ID
	:	
        ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z') ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'0'..'9'|'_'|'.')*
    ;

ENDFEATURE
    :
        "'>" {selector.select("iLexer");}
    ;
SEMI        : ";";
EQ          : "=";
===FeatureMain.java
import antlr.*;
import java.io.*;

class FeatureMain {

public static void main(String[] args) {
try {
	TokenStreamSelector selector =
		 new TokenStreamSelector();
	//
	// Lexer
	//
	IgnoreLexer iLexer = 
		 new IgnoreLexer(new DataInputStream(System.in));
	iLexer.selector = selector;
	FeatureLexer fLexer =
		 new FeatureLexer(iLexer.getInputState());
	fLexer.selector = selector;
		selector.addInputStream(iLexer, "iLexer");
	selector.addInputStream(fLexer, "fLexer");
	selector.select("iLexer");
		Token t = selector.nextToken();
	while(t.getType() != Token.EOF_TYPE) {
		 System.out.println(t);
		 t = selector.nextToken();
	};
 } catch (Exception e) {
	System.err.println("exception: " + e);
	e.printStackTrace();
 }
}

This is a separate "tool" if you want to read in ANTLR grammars and, 
for example, print them out w/o actions.  It's really a starting point 
for people wanting to manipulate or display antlr grammars.  It is part 
of my new ANTLR 3 experimental beast.  I need to read in grammars so I 
can analyze them. :)

Will the existing code generation be re-implemented by
antlr.g TreeParsers?  Seems like an ideal place for
new languages to hook in... though there might be some
reinventing the wheel happening in that case.  It
seems like what is often called for is a way to hook
custom actions into an existing grammar.  Has any
thought been given to whether and how this might be
possible in ANTLR 3, short of copying the existing
grammar's text and inserting actions?  Might this
somehow tie in with the idea of generic ANTLR action
code to be implemented in a target language along with
the rest of the grammar, as outlined in the cabal
notes?

Well, it does compile.  I'm having a look to see if I

Absolutely...the idea believe it or not is really the RCS branch / 
push-forward type of concepts...integrated into a workbench, this will 
be nice.

Yep, we talked about all this at the cabal :)

_GCC:_The_Complete_Reference_ by Arthur Griffith 
ISBN: 0072224053  has a chapter or two on RTL,
gcc's tree language.

Also, try google with: site:gcc.gnu.org porting rtl
gives 800 hits.

Terence,

If antlr3 is table driven rather than being stack
based, you might want to consider inverting the
relationship between the lexer and parser.  In
other words, let the lexer call the parse each
time it recognizes a token.  This will make it
amenable to event driven applications.  Example:
(a) processing xml sax events (b) in the past
some users have seen deadlock problems handling
input from a socket - but I can't recall the
details at the moment (perhaps the parser had
to perform some action to get more data, but
it couldn't do it because it needed one more
token of lookahead).

In-Reply-To: <BB68534C.22E08%sunshine@public.kherson.ua>
Message-ID: <bi1fdd+7eue@eGroups.com>

If you want to see an implementation of code completion you could 
look at the Netbeans IDE (www.netbeans.org, and specifically 
editor.netbeans.org). I had a quick look and the only docs on it are 
user-view docs, but there's a full implementation in there. It does 
code-completion for at least Java and HTML. The implementation is 
language specific though there is a move to pull it out into a 
seperate code-completion module but I don't think this is underway 
yet and again no in-depth programmer docs yet. I think that the Java 
editor uses a hand-built parser.

As with other tools though it's only method completion, no completion 
for keywords as you were talking about. This makes it rather easier 
as then you don't have to deal with incomplete tokens, it's already 
an IDENT (or FIELD_IDENT or TABLE_IDENT) token you just check how it 
could be expanded.

As to keywords, you could drop this in favour of abbreviations which 
is what Netbeans has. e.g. 're' is expanded to 'return'. Though this 
can be a bit annoying as a variable called 're' gets expanded 
to 'return'. But it might be worth thinking about whether it's worth 
having keyword completion. Field\table etc name completion is great 
as you don't have to know them all off by heart but who's gonna 
forget select. And if you had say loj->LEFT OUTER JOIN abbreviations 
and so on you could take care of the longer sequences, there aren't 
many long sequences in SQL. You could even do them outside the ANTLR 
parser, have your Editor Kit do it before lexing\parsing. When a 
space (or whatever you're abbreviation key is) is inserted check what 
it was inserted after. Though depending on your editor implementation 
that may or may not be easy, with a Swing editor kit it wouldn't be 
too bad.

Tom.

Which main line code?  I am reading the XPA code but I
can't make the connection to what it is that Oliver
wants to do with his ASTFactory subclass that
create(String) needs to be public.  I have rebuilt
stuff without that mod and modified the stuff I worked
on to built an AST and I can't seem to break anything
without this change.  Guess we'll have to wait for
Oliver.

Hosting forums at antlr.org may not be a bad idea--I'm getting tired  
of the porn spam and junk virus-laden posts (a good thing that yahoo 
at least filters out the viral attachments).  I suspect that most 
others in the group feel the same way.  Alternatively, can you ask 
yahoo to filter out messages from non-members and crack down on the 
spam?

You have to be a member to post.  These spammers sign up!  I kill them, 
but they just change the name.  The only solution is knowspam.net ;)  
My accounts gets 1000 SPAM a day, but knowspam allows only humans thru! 
  I literally get 40M a day of that damn virus's email.  Knowspam hides 
it from me of course, but i checked to see wuz up once in a while.

I was hoping that it wasn't quite that bad.  Come to think of it, I 
would bet that the new limit on "add members" is a tepid response by 
yahoo to porn spam and that the "delete all attachments" is for 
virus handling.

Well, well, emm, errrr, in short: I am an idiot! You are right! All 
the time I thought I needed that patch, but actually I do not!
I can safely overload create(String) in my subclass and make it 
publicly accessible.

Well, you want to know why it has to be public in the first place? 
Hopefully I am not wrong again, but I need it to write something like
#["<xml>"] for tree construction.

This would be a very good thing. I participate in a project at 
jakarta.apache.org and they have got read access for CVS for 
everyone. When you get read/write access you need SSH tools 
communicating with a SSH daemon on their side. Another example is 
sourceforge. Similar thing for read/write.

But this is *CVS*. Do not know how to do it with perforce. Is it 
accessible over the net in the first place? What about client 
licenses? Thought I heard it is free for open source development? 
Are there plugins available for the prominent IDEs?

Although I know the advantages of perforce over CVS and you would 
not want to switch back to CVS when you have seen perforce, would 
you consider making ANTLR visible to the outside with CVS? The 
drawback would be you would have to merge your changes in perforce 
with CVS and vice-versa. The advantage is everybody knows CVS and 
has the tools for it.

Not a perfect solution, but maybe worth thinking about it ;)

As far as I know it is designed to overcome the most obvious
limitations of CVS:
- lack of transactional support
- no *global* configuration management
- no versioning of folders
- proprietary network protocol

It requires an underlying RDBMS and supports a subset of WebDAV and
DeltaV for easy communication over HTTP/HTTPS.

I think it will take quite a while until subversion can take the place
of CVS - if ever...

I've been anxiously been awaiting subversion, but I cannot risk our code to
something that hasn't had much testing (which is a chicken&egg problem).  I
did speak with someone who has been using it for a while and they haven't
had any problems.  We currently use CVS and it hasn't let me down yet.  But,
having a free version control system with intelligent, atomic merging would
be a big step forward!

This shouldn't be interpreted as a knock against Perforce which I only hear
good things about...it's just that Perforce and Clearcase, while very nice,
are not free.

Given that this is the Antlr forum, let me humbly suggest that you go check
out www.perforce.com for those answers (which are "yes", BTW :-).

To be more clear, the Perforce client applications are free and available
for most platforms.

There are plug-ins for some IDEs but since I prefer the command-line
perforce client, I don't keep track of which IDEs are supported or not.

Perforce does license their server for open-source projects for no cost.
That's what Ter is running for Antlr.

We've been using subversion with great success for about 6 months now for
both local and networked projects (apache webdav). The biggest project we're
using it for has over 3K files (some of them binary files: images and even
mp3). It didn't fail us once.

While subversion may eventually get to the point where it's safe to use for
production, I'm not holding my breath for it.

The open-source SCM system that I'm most interested in is OpenCM.org.  It's
being headed up by Jonathan Shapiro of the EROS capability-based operating
system fame.  Alas, development is moving slowly given their workload.

FWIW, Perforce makes their server available for free to anyone.  The only
limitation being that it will only support two users and two clients.
I used that for years for my own, personal development work at home.

Subject: [antlr-interest] [C++] How to init varaibles of MyParser ?
Message-ID: <BB77EC58.23BBF%sunshine@public.kherson.ua>

Hi guys,

Assume I do such parser

-------------------------------------------------
class VSQL_Parser extends Parser;

{
    public:
        std::ostream*   mstream;
static  bool            print_error_to_console;

void reportError(const antlr::RecognitionException& ex)
{
    if( mstream ) 
        *mstream << ex.toString().c_str() << '\n';

    if( print_error_to_console )
        std::cout << ex.toString().c_str() << '\n';
}

}
-------------------------------------------------


Question is, how I can make ANTLR to generate C++ sources that will init
mstream on construction of parser instance ???

PROBLEM IS:

1) I cannot define own version of constructor in the above { } section.

2) because ANTLR produce the next constructors for parser:

-------------------------------------------------
VSQL_Parser::VSQL_Parser(antlr::TokenBuffer& tokenBuf, int k)
: antlr::LLkParser(tokenBuf,k)
{
}

VSQL_Parser::VSQL_Parser(antlr::TokenBuffer& tokenBuf)
: antlr::LLkParser(tokenBuf,2)
{
}

-------------------------------------------------

3) I think only way to resolve this problem is that ANTLR need generate
constructors that call some InitSelf() method. I can then define such
method.

Yes, this method cannot be virtual.

4) or anybody knows other trick?
