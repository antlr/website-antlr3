Clinical Quality Language (CQL) is a high-level, human-readable programming language. It's a standard developed by Health Level Seven International (HL7) and is widely used in the healthcare industry.

Clinical Quality Measures (CQMs) are standardized metrics used to assess the quality of healthcare services, measure patient outcomes, and evaluate the performance of healthcare providers and organizations.

CQL serves as a bridge between the clinical knowledge and the technical specifications needed to calculate and report on CQMs. It allows healthcare professionals and health IT developers to express complex clinical logic and criteria in a structured and standardized manner. This is important because CQMs often involve intricate clinical rules, conditions, and criteria that need to be evaluated against patient data to determine if certain quality goals have been met.
