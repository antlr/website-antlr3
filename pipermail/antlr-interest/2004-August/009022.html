<PRE>I hope this is an intermediate question and not an obvious newbie stumble.
I've read the manual and the FAQ and I just don't have a handle on
syntactic predicates for looking backwards.

I think I merely want to know what the PREVIOUS token actually was, so
I can rewrite the stream.

For example in Java source, I want to replace an identifier with a
getter. However, if the identifier is the operand of a decrement or
increment unary operator, I want to leave it alone:

j = _i ;// becomes j = getI();
_i++; // stays the same. Easy to detect, just look ahead.
--_i; // stays the same. I need to look back to see if the previous
Token is an INC or DEC

The easiest place to put my re-write method is within the identPrimary
rule. But at that point, I need to know if the previous token was an
INC or DEC and must therefore be unmodified. If I add a re-write
method within the rule for pre-increment or decrement, then I need
lots of logic to enable and disable the rewrite at identPrimary.

So, um
 what can I do?

Thanks,

Charlweed
