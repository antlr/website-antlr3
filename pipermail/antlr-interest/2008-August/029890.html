<PRE>Well, so much for that idea then :(

Guess the only way to do this then is to indeed duplicate the knowledge inherent in the parser to a different checker. Oh well.

I have found one series of 3 articles that might be interesting for such situation: 

<A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/opensource/libraryview.jsp?search_by=Create+commercial-quality+eclipse+ide">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/opensource/libraryview.jsp?search_by=Create+commercial-quality+eclipse+ide</A>

But I don't know if you could achieve that easily (if someone knows a way or tool I would be interested too in knowing it). ANTLR parsers generated from grammars are not 'self-aware' if I understood correctly: they are LR parsers but don't hold as such a graph based on the grammar that could determine the next allowed token.

Yours sincerely,

Stanislas Herman.

No problem, thanks anyway.

 

Does anyone else have any idea how to do this?

 

Thanks in advance.

OK, well it sounds like you know what you&#8217;re doing. 

 

Sorry I wasn&#8217;t able to help more,

Yes, I didn&#8217;t understand exactly what you&#8217;re trying to do (and probably still don&#8217;t). If you&#8217;re thinking of it like an Intellisense problem, then there are other ways of solving that kind of problem without using a parser-generator like Antlr. Have you already considered those? 

 

It sounds like your problem is a bit different than the code editor&#8217;s &#8211; simpler, actually. Whatever rules you use to decide what pieces can go where may be more easily expressed with a custom solution.  You could use Antlr to parse any text input, but call custom code to make sense of it and decide what the set of following pieces is. This would not only be more efficient, but would be far less frustrating to develop, since you have full control over the decision mechanism and can customize the underlying data structures to fit the task. Depending upon how simple your sequencing rules are, you might even be able to use a regular expression solution, if you can choose the text representation of the pieces.

Hello Brent,

 

It seems my question wasn&#8217;t clear enough. I have no intention of having a dynamic grammar. What I meant by disabling puzzle pieces is this: on the left side of the screen there is a list of all the possible puzzle pieces, a library if you will. From there the user drags pieces to the right side of the screen to form sequences of puzzle pieces. What I want to do is disable the pieces in the library. An alternative way of looking at it is seeing it as Intellisense/code completion. While the user is typing (dragging pieces), I want to display a popup list of all the possible words (pieces) that can come at the current position in the sentence. The grammar itself is completely fixed, just like the grammar of programming languages that allow code completion.

My guess is that this will be pretty difficult to implement using even an augmented context-free grammar. Usually, you would parse any valid sentence (a list of puzzle pieces, in your case), then do the semantic analysis as a later pass (iterate over the actual puzzle pieces entered and check each one for validity). 

 

Multiple passes should make the code easier to write (as well as maintain). And error reporting should be more intuitive. It&#8217;s pretty difficult to enforce all semantic meaning at the parse phase and still output meaningful error messages.

 

If you really want to experiment with changing the grammar dynamically, though, you could generate an AST in your parser for any valid sentence, and then use semantic predicates in your tree grammar to turn on and off certain rules. But I think you&#8217;ll find that just adding validity checks in your tree grammar actions will be the most straightforward, providing all the advantages of a multi-pass interpreter.

 

Brent

Subject: [antlr-interest] How to get a list of all valid options for the next token?

 

Hello everyone,

 

I&#8217;m making a program where users construct short sentences by combining puzzle pieces. This series of puzzle pieces is then converted to text and parsed by Antlr. Currently the user has access to all the different pieces at any point in the sentence, even if the grammar would not be able to parse this. I want to disable all the pieces that cannot come at that point in the sentence.

My idea was to do this with the help of the exceptions the parser generates. For example, when it throws a MismatchedTokenException I can find the expected token through the Expecting property of the exception. Unfortunately this only works when there&#8217;s only one possibility. When there are multiple it instead throws a NoViableAltException or a MismatchedSetException. I haven&#8217;t been able to find a list of valid following tokens in their properties.

 

Can anyone tell me if there is any way of determining the list of valid tokens after the current token in the sentence?

 

Thanks in advance.
