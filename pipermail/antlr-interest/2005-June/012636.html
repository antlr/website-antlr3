Hi !

&gt;<i> The way you respond to mr. Blomberg tells me that at your level of
</I>&gt;<i> knowlegde of Parsing and Parser technology you do not any longer
</I>&gt;<i> comprehend the problems beginners are struggling with: You ask  
</I>&gt;<i> questions
</I>&gt;<i> the novice / beginner does NOT know how to answer because (he / she /
</I>&gt;<i> we) are trying to grasp the concept.
</I>
Well, I do have to teach students this stuff on a regular  
basis...seems I succeed sometimes...

&gt;<i> Please do take this as constructive feedback as better  
</I>&gt;<i> documentation is
</I>&gt;<i> indeed needed to get the beginners going.
</I>
I appreciate all feedback!  I want my doc to be as helpful as  
possible.  I plan on an O'Reilly style ANTLR book first then a  
&quot;language translation&quot; book next.

&gt;<i> I have completed my first small Programming Language in ANTLR that
</I>&gt;<i> exeuctes by Tree Walking,
</I>
Good for you!

&gt;<i> and I still do not fully understand what you
</I>&gt;<i> ask Mr. Blomberg... Maybe again it's me...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> E.g. You asked:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;&lt;What do you mean by parser  tokens?  Do you mean imaginary tokens
</I>&gt;<i> inserted by the parser for  which no actual input lexeme exists?&gt;&gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> Well,
</I>&gt;<i> why doesn't the docs explain more of this stuff? I still do not
</I>
I was actually just wondering what a &quot;parser token&quot; was as *I* hadn't  
heard the term and didn't know what he was asking. ;)

&gt;<i> Any programming tool has its own set of programming Idioms, this is  
</I>&gt;<i> also
</I>&gt;<i> the case with ANTLR: When I first started off with ANTLR, there where
</I>&gt;<i> two problems that kept me occupied:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) How to parse my language
</I>&gt;<i> 2) How to execute it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what docs where available to help with this: All over the net there
</I>&gt;<i> are examples on how to execute Expressins ( 2+ 3 etc) using Tree
</I>&gt;<i> walking. But how to execute an IF statement, or a LOOP ?
</I>
True, the examples are more complicated.  The problem you have though  
is a general &quot;how do I build an interpreter&quot; problem, which has  
nothing to do with ANTLR really.  ANTLR is just the structure  
recognizer.  You need to learn about symbol tables, exec  
environments, and a bunch of other stuff.  Perhaps my grad course  
notes can help you out there.

&gt;<i> The more advanced examples like TINY Basic is for a beginner mind
</I>&gt;<i> boggling. Why not make a minimalistic example that shows BOTH how to
</I>&gt;<i> parse and execute:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a) Expressions
</I>&gt;<i> b) statements
</I>&gt;<i> c) loops
</I>&gt;<i> d) conditionals
</I>&gt;<i> e) execute simple function calls
</I>
Sounds great!  When you finish with yours, can you post it or some of  
it?

&gt;<i> One of the &quot;Patterns&quot; I have found is to create what I call &quot;Holders&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i> They are ANTLR Tree Walker subtrees created duing Parsing that do not
</I>&gt;<i> immediately execute when the tree is walked, but can be called to  
</I>&gt;<i> do so
</I>&gt;<i> conditionally by calling another Tree Walker Rule that executes the
</I>&gt;<i> Holders. This is at least how I managed conditionals and loops.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then the docs need explain how to make the language case sensitive or
</I>&gt;<i> not (I still haven't got ANTLR to accept my camel-case grammar with
</I>&gt;<i> keywords like &quot;myKeyword&quot;).  Also the concept of
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the Lexer we need to understand how to parse more complex numbers
</I>&gt;<i> like 1e10 etc. How to define a charVocabulary is also important and  
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> trivial to the beginner.
</I>
Yes, this I hope is much easier in 3.0...

&gt;<i> Then it is the issue of reporting Errors and thus to get hold of  
</I>&gt;<i> Source
</I>&gt;<i> Code positions. I may have forgotten some details here, but I think I
</I>&gt;<i> had to implement my own ASTFactory to get hold of the source position
</I>&gt;<i> (getColumn() getLine()) for my Tokens (here we go again: What  
</I>&gt;<i> Tokens?).
</I>
Yes, this was a big mistake in 2.x and the tree parsers essentially  
suck at error reporting.

&gt;<i> I also discovered that the concept of Line and Column is NOT very
</I>&gt;<i> usefull. I will try to explain why: At least Java Editors want the
</I>&gt;<i> OFFSET in the text to highlight a position (like we want to do to
</I>&gt;<i> highlight a parsing error).  Now, in my case I wanted to hide parts of
</I>&gt;<i> the source to the user: Call it Headers and Footers of my language,  
</I>&gt;<i> so I
</I>&gt;<i> parsed out the part I wanted to show to the user, and wanted to report
</I>&gt;<i> error positions releative to this: It then turns out that the  
</I>&gt;<i> concept of
</I>&gt;<i> Line and Column breaks down, and that indeed OFFSET is the only  
</I>&gt;<i> sensible
</I>&gt;<i> positioning system. So I changed my lexer to only uppdate column and
</I>&gt;<i> never increment line: Thus getColumn() is now the offset!
</I>
In 3.0, the column is now char position in line and the token doesn't  
have a string--it has indexes into the text buffer start/stop for  
that token :)

&gt;<i> There are more problems I have been struggling with, but this is  
</I>&gt;<i> what I
</I>&gt;<i> remember right now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, there is the issue of licensing: Can you PLEASE put up a link
</I>&gt;<i> to the licensing policies that exists for version 3.0?
</I>
I give my students a demerit when they ask a quesiton that is on the  
first page of google.  In this case, &quot;antlr  license&quot; reveals the  
first entry as your answer:

<A HREF="http://www.antlr.org/license.html">http://www.antlr.org/license.html</A>

&gt;<i> I know it will be under the BSD license:  Where do I find it?
</I>
Try google again and the first entry is what you want.

&gt;<i> And, as reading foreign language license polices is not the simplest
</I>&gt;<i> thing in the world, can someone in plain english explain whether  
</I>&gt;<i> the BSD
</I>&gt;<i> license still gives me the right to use ANTLR 3.x and onwards for
</I>&gt;<i> commercial usel, or am I know stuck with 2.x
</I>
BSD says you can do what you want, but don't sue me.  Also, i make no  
guarantee that the code won't destroy all life on this planet. ;)  It  
means you can do anything you want commercially with it. :)
