<PRE>Dear all,

I am trying to parse a message that contains parameters values like &lt;PARAM_NAME&gt; &lt;VALUE&gt;, for instance &quot;STATION EST1&quot;.
Here is a very simple extract of my grammar for one of these parameters (the one given in the above example):

grammar test;

KEYWORD_STATION :       'STATION';
DIGIT    :        '0'..'9';
LETTER  :        'a'..'z' | 'A'..'Z';
SPACE   :       ' ';

stationParameter        :       KEYWORD_STATION SPACE stationName;
stationName     :       LETTER LETTER LETTER DIGIT;


The point is that when I try to parse my example message (STATION EST1), I get a MismatchTokenException at the point where the parser attempts to read the last &quot;ST1&quot;. After some analysis, I understood that the lexer generated the following tokens: KEYWORD_STATION SPACE LETTER for the string &quot;STATION E&quot;  and then attempted to match the remaining &quot;ST1&quot; with KEYWORD_STATION but failed to complete it.

At this point, I would expect the lexer to backtrack to the beginning of 'ST1' and then match it with LETTER LETTER DIGIT, but it doesn't.

I have tried various combinations of &quot;backtrack&quot;, &quot;memorize&quot; and &quot;k&quot; options without any success. I must have missed something. (Should it help, I use ANTLRWorks 1.4).

Please could you tell me how to proceed in order to make the lexer backtrack and try other alternatives when a keyword of my language is not exactly matched ?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Best Regards,

Philippe Coujoulou.
