<PRE>yeah,I like the idea a lot too, but I'm also worried about the tools.jar thing.

when it comes down to it, ST v3 was the fastest in the world but it worked for most people. STv4 is at least two times faster so I think perhaps we can just leave it is as-is for now. The easier thing to do might be to generate Java code from the templates and give people a jar to include in their application. The only problem is dynamic  field and method eval is still there. without static types, I'm not sure there's a real reason to add the complexity of generating java.

&gt;<i> Ahh yes the compiler API, it's very cool. I remember experimenting with this to do something similar to what you want, I was implementing a simple interface that just returned a value and it was faster then reflection at the time. I would warn though that using tools.jar in an application is not a simple matter. tools.jar comes with a JDK because it is bound to that jdk. As an example my current application uses JMX dynamic attach, also in tools.jar. We have to compile against one tools.jar and then add the jdk's tools.jar at run time to the classpath at install time. This is becouse tools.jar has platform dependent code in it, or it refrences platform dependand libraries. It's possible that the compiler API uses nothing of the native libraries and that it might work to include tools.jar as a part of ST, but I wouldn't count on it. ASM, cglib, and javasist all try to do the same kinds of things... just in a more verbose way that I've never been able to get my head around completely yet.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i wonder how easy this is in java using ASM or whatever.  i'd have to generate stubs and then figure out how to load. it's a solved problem but i wonder if there is a simple example.
