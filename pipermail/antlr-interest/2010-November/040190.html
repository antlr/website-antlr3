                      <A HREF="http://www.iceccs.org/2011">http://www.iceccs.org/2011</A>

             16th Annual IEEE International Conference on the
             Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS)
sponsored by the IEEE Technical Committee on Complexity in Computing (TCCX)

                         April 27th-29th, 2011
                          Las Vegas, NV, USA

************************************************************************

          Extended Submission deadline: December 15th, 2010
          --------------------------------------------------

The success of key human activities ranging from research and business to
everyday services relies on the use of ever more sophisticated,
feature-rich and complex computer systems. These complex computer systems
are regularly required to accomplish more, faster and on a broader scale,
to adapt dynamically to changing workloads, scenarios and objectives, and
to achieve guaranteed levels of performance and dependability. Satisfying
such demanding requirements in the presence of the variability,
heterogeneity and non-linear behaviour that characterise complex computer
systems poses numerous challenges to both their developers and their
users.

The aim of the conference is to bring together researchers, practitioners
and leading experts from academia and industry, to advance the state of
the art in the specification, development, validation and verification,
and management of complex computer systems.

Scope and topics:
================

Authors are invited to submit papers describing original, unpublished
research results, case studies and tools. Additionally, submissions of
poster papers are sought for two separate poster sessions: an &quot;ongoing
research&quot; poster session, and a &quot;PhD research&quot; poster session. Topics of
interest include but are not limited to the following aspects of complex
computer systems:

- Requirement specification and analysis
- Verification and validation
- Model-driven development
- Reverse engineering and refactoring
- Design by contract
- Agile methods
- Safety-critical &amp; fault-tolerant architectures
- Adaptive, self-managing and multi-agent systems
- Real-time, hybrid and embedded systems
- Systems of systems
- Tools and tool integration
- Industrial case studies

Different kinds of contributions are sought, including novel research,
lessons learned, experience reports, and discussions of practical problems
faced by industry and user domains. The ultimate goal is to build a rich
and comprehensive conference program that can fit the interests and needs
of different classes of attendees: professionals, researchers, managers,
and students. A program goal is to organize several sessions that include
both academic and industrial papers on a given topic, and culminate with
panels to discuss relationships between industrial and academic research.

Full papers are divided into two categories: Technical Papers and
Experience Reports. The papers submitted to both categories will be
reviewed by program committee members, and papers accepted in either
category will be published in the conference proceedings. Technical papers
should describe original research, and experience reports should present
practical projects carried out in industry, and reflect on the lessons
learnt from them.

Poster paper submissions should specify in their abstract whether they
describe ongoing or PhD research. Both types of poster papers will be
reviewed by program committee members, and accepted posters will be
published in the conference proceedin


Submission of Papers:
====================

Submitted manuscripts should be in English and formatted in the style of
the IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Format. Papers should not exceed 10
pages for full papers and 2 pages for poster papers, including figures,
references, and appendices. All submissions should be in PDF format.
Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be
rejected immediately, without review.

See the submission guidelines on the conference web site.

Important Dates:
================

Submission of titles and abstracts            ASAP
Submission of all papers                      15 December, 2010
Notification of acceptance                    10 January,  2011
Camera-ready material for publication         31 January,  2011
Registration deadline for authors             10 February, 2011
Early registration deadline for non-authors   22 February, 2011
