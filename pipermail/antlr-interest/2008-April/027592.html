<PRE>If this cannot be don't now, then it is a mistake in the generating templates as that is what is supposed to happen, so I will look into it. Perhaps I have left some casts in the templates.

</I>&gt;<i> This same approach ought to still be possible in C -- substituting

</I>&gt;<i> semantics, of course.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So the default ANTLR3_COMMON_TREE_ADAPTOR creates and manipulates
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR3_COMMON_TREE objects, but the interface specified by
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR3_BASE_TREE_ADAPTOR only ever uses 'void *'.  This means that
</I>&gt;<i> a user can completely reimplement the interface to use their own
</I>&gt;<i> custom node type totally divorced from ANTLR.  The
</I>&gt;<i> ANTLR3_BASE_TREE structure simply goes away, as it's no longer
</I>&gt;<i> useful.  (Or maybe you could still have two levels; one which
</I>&gt;<i> implements the basic tree semantics and one that adds the token
</I>&gt;<i> payload.  But I'm not sure that's especially useful.)
