     "OperatingSystem, are used for user interface and file "
     "support, and a RISC Processor and its OS are used for complex "
     "mathematical operations, this could be modeled as two "
     "ComputerSystems where one aggregates the other. In some cases, "
     "this could be modeled as a Cluster. The difference is the "
