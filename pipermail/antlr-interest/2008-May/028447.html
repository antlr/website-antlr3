<PRE>Hi,
I've been developing a Sybase SQL stored proc parser using ANTLR3, and 
have run into the problem of dealing with nested comments

e.g.

/*
select  * 
from hello  /* table*/
where
field1 = 'world' /* field*/

*/

Ideally, I need to retain the line numbers whilst removing any nested 
comments,

any ideas ?

regards
Mark.
