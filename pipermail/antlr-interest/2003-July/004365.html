- see section 6(a) and others
They can not even improve performance (!) - section 7(a)iii

Well, you are right. It can be compatible but ... they (MS) would 
need a new license for it. Current license does not allow them to go 
beyond version 1.1.4 (<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/pr/2001/01/pr010123-">http://java.sun.com/pr/2001/01/pr010123-</A>
01.html).

I think MS is just afraid that if they continue to develop new 
versions compatible with new &quot;official&quot; versions Sun could try to 
prove in court that this is still Java but named J#. (J++ was not 
named Java too). And they would probably win.

Of course MS could get a new license but I am not sure they actually 
could. And right now, I am sure, they do not want to.
Remember, whatever they say this is primary about business and 
competition.

&gt;<i> MS is acting like a spoilt brat
</I>
Well, I think it is kind of new Sun's point of view, when they want 
MS to distribute their VM :) But read their older statements...

Cheers,
Tom Jastrzebski

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was also able to use J# to generate Tool.exe file for .NET
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As Tom mentioned, there was only one change needed, which it

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They did not forget. This is a legal issue. J# can be Java
