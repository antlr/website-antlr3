Evaluation Tests
Filter-nested - 1 
Approved 
A FILTER is in scope for variables bound at the same level of the query tree 
Filter-nested - 2 
Approved 
A FILTER in a group { ... } cannot see variables bound outside that group 
Filter-placement - 1 
Approved 
FILTER placed after the triple pattern that contains the variable tested 
Filter-placement - 2 
Approved 
FILTERs are scoped to the nearest enclosing group - placement within that group does not matter 
Filter-placement - 3 
Approved 
FILTERs are scoped to the nearest enclosing group - placement within that group does not matter 
Filter-scope - 1 
Approved 
FILTERs in an OPTIONAL do not extend to variables bound outside of the LeftJoin(...) operation 
Join operator with OPTs, BGPs, and UNIONs 
Approved 
Tests nested combination of Join with a BGP / OPT and a BGP / UNION 
Join operator with Graph and Union 
Approved 
Tests combination of Join operator with Graph on LHS and Union on RHS 
Join scope - 1 
Approved 
Variables have query scope. 
Nested Optionals - 1 
Approved 
Nested-optionals with a shared variable that does not appear in the middle pattern (a not well-formed query pattern as per "Semantics and Complexity" of SPARQL 
Nested Optionals - 2 
Approved 
OPTIONALs parse in a left-associative manner 
Optional-filter - 1 
Approved 
A FILTER inside an OPTIONAL can reference a variable bound in the required part of the OPTIONAL 
Optional-filter - 2 filters 
Approved 
FILTERs inside an OPTIONAL can refer to variables from both the required and optional parts of the construct. 
Optional-filter - scope of variable

dawg-bnode-coreference 
Approved 
Query results must maintain bnode co-references in the dataset 
Test 'boolean effective value' - true 
Approved 
Non-zero numerics, non-empty strings, and the true boolean have an EBV of true 
Test 'boolean effective value' - false 
Approved 
Zero-valued numerics, the empty string, and the false boolean have an EBV of false 
Test 'boolean effective value' - && 
Approved 
The && operator takes the EBV of its operands 
Test 'boolean effective value' - || 
Approved 
The || operator takes the EBV of its operands 
Test 'boolean effective value' - optional 
Approved 
The EBV of an unbound value or a literal with an unknown datatype is a type error, which eliminates the solution in question 
Test 'boolean effective value' - unknown types 
Approved 
Negating a type error is still a type error 
Test literal 'true'
