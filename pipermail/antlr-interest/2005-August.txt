There's no right answer - just choose one, get on with it, and regret it 
at your leisure afterwards.

If you wanted a poll, then I (currently):

- use heterogeneous

- have about 120 node types

- don't use tree grammars

- 7 passes; 1 creates the tree, 2 further ones modify the tree structure

- do manual tree walks

- (very) occasionally have to look back up the tree for context

- the tree structures should be correct by design, but I still have lots 
of assertion checks in my walkers to manually validate the structure

This seems to work well.

Note that I *don't* have 120 source files for all these classes; that 
would be ridiculous. Very few classes need to override methods, and I 
combine 'functionality' into files, rather than 'types'. Sometimes I 
also find it simpler, clearer, and more maintainable just to 'switch' on 
a node's type than to use polymorphism; the hetero approach certainly 
doesn't exclude this.

The only difficult part of the process is that I have 3 files which 
define the basic node types, define the AST subclasses themselves, and 
list the factory methods. This is messy, easy to get wrong, and 
difficult to maintain. On the other hand, it's trivial and a lot of it 
could be automated with a script.

Message-ID: <16271.194.237.142.7.1122888791.squirrel@www.scorpiondata.com>

Hi,

I'm using an ANTLR parser to detect syntax errors in a c-like language.
Currently if the lexer runs into for instance the char "?" (which is not a
part of my language) it will throw a NoViableAltForCharException which is
then wrapped into a TokenStreamRecognitionException. I catch this and
display the syntax error in my editor.

The problem is that ANTLR seems to stop parsing too at this time. Instead
I would like it to throw an exception as above, but then just ignore that
character and resume lexing more or less as if the erroneous char never
appeared (it should also, if possible, start over with flushed buffer so
that the chars "func?tion" will not be interpretted as a valid "function"
token.

Is this possible with ANTLR 2.7.5 ? Are there any examples of this?



Sincerly,
Martin

You can define lexer rule that accepts any wrong chars.
The action for this rule should report error and skip
wrong token. It is very similar to comment handling
except for error reporting.

in lexer:

protected ERROR: "?"
{
    // report error
    $setType(Token.SKIP);
}

So, in case of "func?tion" parser will receive
two ID tokens: "func" and "tion".

Alexey

Please keep in mind tha the 2.7.6 that comes with the plugin is

Thanks Alexey. I've been tampering with this lexer error handling for 8h
now, but now finally it works for the "?" char atleast!

Now, is it possible to generalize this rule into something that traps more
or less everything that the lexer doesn't understand? I mean if someone
enters some other obscure char like ? into the source I want that
highlighted as a syntax error too (still without the lexer/parser stopping
its operation). I could of course add another rule just like the one
below, but there is too many chars that is not used in my language so I
would rather have a general rule if possible.

I also have another question on the same theme. My language does
assignments using the ::= operator and comparisions using the == operator.
Lot's of users will try to assign variables using the = operator instead.
Currently when someone tries to use "x=blah" my lexer believes that the =
is a partial == and thus it says "found 'b' but expected '='". This is all
very well, but at this stage the lexer also aborts its operations. All the
stuff below the faulty assignment does not get parsed. In this case I
would like something similar to what you taught me above, ie I dont want
the lexer to stop; I just want it to mark the = as a "bad token syntax
error" and then keep on going. Is this doable too maybe?

Sorry for the misunderstanding, I meant the 3.0 EA releases.

I submitted a combined  grammar/lexer example for EA3 feedback whereby
if you have a whole bunch of literals like say (artificially):

keywords: "A" "AB" "IF" "IFE" "BLAH" "BLAHBLAH" .... ;

Then at a certain limit the generated lexer is broken.

I can readily resubmit this if it was lost in the mix of million emails.

Message-ID: <E1DzfsX-0005mF-Je@smtpauth01.mail.atl.earthlink.net>

I need for my tree nodes to store the associated Token.  

When I explicitly set a node type with the <AST=typename> option, there
seems to be no problem as the Token is passed to the constructor for the
node and I can capture it.

However, it seems that when I set a default node type using the
myParser.setASTNodeType("...") option, a different node constructor is used
and I don't have the option to capture the Token.  Is there a solution other
than explicitly setting the node type for each token?

Thanks,

Hello Everyone,

 

I am developing a simple typed language.  So far things have been going very well. Thanks to ANTLR and existing grammar samples, I have been able to create an AST without too much trouble.  

 

However, now I find that my grammar allows for statements such as TRUE > FALSE.  I would like to catch issues like this through semantic/type checking routines.

 

------>QUESTION 1: Is this a correct approach?  I mean should I catch these types of errors through semantic analysis or should I be relying on the parser to catch them?

 

My grammar also allows for variables so I really doubt that I can rely on the parser for all type checking.  So I decided to use ?my own? AST nodes and attempt type checking either recursively or using the VISITOR design pattern.

 

However, I haven?t seen any examples out there that approach the problem in this manner.  So


 

------>QUESTION 2: Is there a better way to do type checking or semantic analysis in ANTLR?  Are there any examples out there?  (or am I on the right track :-)?

 

Best Regards,

Houman

My choice would be to do type checking through semantic analysis,
because that kind of construction is sintactically correct, IMO.

What I've been doing in my translators is to do type checking
recursively within actions in a tree parser, using my own AST nodes,
as you said. These nodes store information about the expression they
represent, like type, L-Value, and so...

I'm trying to get to grips with parser rules, lexer rules, tokens, and the
like.

I've come accross a parser rule that contains a mixture of rule references
and tokens:

functionIdentifier
    : DAY
    | YEAR
<many more tokens>
    | constantIdentifier
    ;

So that I can easily add actions to get the text of the token, I thought
I'd be clever and bunch the tokens up in a lexer rule, then reference this
from the parser rule:

functionIdentifier
    : MY_STUFF
    | constantIdentifier
    ;

(and in the lexer)

MY_STUFF
    : DAY
    | YEAR
<more>
    ;

When I try to compile this, I get errors about lexer rules for DAY, YEAR,
etc not being defined.  I thought I could use tokens in lexer rules...?

Can anyone point out the obvious issue that I'm missing?

John

Hi,

Basically, to create the parser. I did the following.
1. Use Antlr.tool to generate java class
2. Create Main Java class to invoke those parser/lexer.

Anybody know how to generate the parser from the grammar file without
create the java class file.

Thanks

??? this seems to be completely unrelated to the question I asked...

At any rate, if you want to use java, you can't really do without the .java
and .class files.  You could bundle everything up into a jar file if you
wanted to have a single file for distribution/execution.  Perhaps you want
the C version of antlr.

JConner,
 Show us a bit more more of ur grammar and then maybe i can tell the problem.
Are the DAY, YEAR,etc defined as tokens in the lexer?

Subject: [antlr-interest] Problems with generated code
Message-ID: <B531C0E49256D511B84700508BBBB6CD04A300F8@UKEXCH1>

I am porting some code from the Java that used ANTLR for parsing an input
string to C#.

I am having a problem with the generated parser, specifically the ASTFactory
initialisation.

My tokens are defines as follows (in the grammar file):

	EXECUTE="execute";  
	
INSERT="insert"<AST=SystemsUnion.Reporting.Server.Execution.SQLParser.Insert
AST>;
	...

When I generate the parser and lexer the following code is generated which
does not compile:

	static public void initializeASTFactory( ASTFactory factory ) {
		factory.setMaxNodeType(79);
		factory.setTokenTypeASTNodeType("insert",
"SystemsUnion.Reporting.Server.Execution.SQLParser.InsertAST");
		factory.setTokenTypeASTNodeType("select",
"SystemsUnion.Reporting.Server.Execution.SQLParser.SelectAST");
		...

The first argument to setTokenTypeAsTNodeType should be an int and not a
string. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? 

Thanks,
Theo Harper

Prashant,

It's the 2000+ line fgl.g grammer here -
http://www.antlr.org/grammar/1073355410988/fgl.g - if you want to see it in
full.  It works - it's just my modification outlined earlier that doesn't.

Yes - the tokens are defined in the lexer just below the class definition
in the tokens { .. } block - eg:

tokens {
  ABSOLUTE         = "absolute"        ;
  AFTER            = "after"           ;
<more>
  DAY              = "day"             ;
<more>
  MONTH            = "MONTH"           ;
<etc>

So it seems to me that I can use tokens in parser rules but not lexer rules
- this just doesn't seem right at all...  I must be doing something wrong -
but I don't know what.

John

What version of ANTLR are you using?. 2.7.5 is the latest 

[I should note that Ric Klaren and Scott Stansfield distribute more recent
variants of 2.7.5 (Scott calls his 2.7.6).]

In the meantime, I'll do a quick test here myself...

Search the list for the relevant messages I imagine.

I should mention that AFAICT, the C# portion of ANTLR is [largely] unchanged
from 2.7.5 in all the new versions. Perhaps some bugfixes...

Cheers,

The newer versions are all "unofficial", however if you look at the mailing

the latest Eclipse plugin - google for "ANTLR Eclipse")

Hi,

Is it possible to define a catch-all rule in the lexer that will catch 
anything that is not catched by other rules?

I intend to use this rule for reporting a syntax error and then setting 
Token.SKIP and let the lexer continue it's work.

Read the ANTLR document please.

http://www.antlrstudio.com/articles/article-grammarlayout/grammarLayout.htm

All you need to do is to put this at the beginning of the grammar:

header {
package your.package;
}

Message-ID: <3AC103F1B7EEEC48A855ACB1D2819E910477F01D@rock-corpmail.microfocus.com>

Hi Barry,
            A converter to transport a yacc grammar to an Antlr grammar
might be helpful.  Some on this list have attempted going from one "style"
or another  to Antlr.  My only experience is with BNF and yacc grammars.  It
is possible to automate some pieces of the conversion with a Yacc=>Antlr
form grammar.  I have not attempted to save time in this fashion. The
recursions and simple repeat items are tricky.  That still doesn't get you
too far down the road to making sure your actions are occurring in the
correct order.
            On another plane, Antlr doesn't think like yacc.  Yacc lexer has
the "longest rule wins" attitude.  Antlr doesn't allow lexical ambiguities.
Yacc parser has a "first rule wins" attitude.  Antlr doesn't allow
reduce/reduce or shift/reduce conflicts.  Yacc passes back a yylval.  Antlr
passes back Tokens - whatever kind you want to make.
 
            Sorry to ramble, but I'll stop here and summarize.  The motion
of Yacc grammar conversion to Antlr grammar is process that may be
automated, but has to be hand checked, IMO.  The mechanisms in your yacc
actions will need rethinking, if only to keep them correct.  On the positive
side,  Antlr is a much more powerful base from which to operate.  
Jim

My $0.02:

I don't think translating a general yacc /program/ is practical - a
/grammar/, perhaps, but that means no actions anywhere.  That's
interesting in theory, but not really of that much practical value.

The other side of this is that you want the people maintaining the
code to know ANTLR at the end, as well - therefore, it may be of more
benefit to have them learn ANTLR, and then translate (by hand) the
yacc /programs/.

Having the people learn the idioms for yacc's "left recursion" and
"right recursion", as well as how precedence is handled in Antlr, will
go many miles towards having a maintainable product when you are
finished - instead of a generated pile of code that no one
understands.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Dynamically changing inputstream or AST node
	structure during parsing ?
Message-ID: <002601c599c5$57ba6e90$79f53951@thedude>

Hi,

I would like to know if it is possible to change the input stream (or AST node structure) during parsing.
For instance, let's say that I have to interpret a 'function'  expression like this :
<<
int x=1
if (x < 10) then x=f02() endif
return x
>>

where f02 is also 'function expression' stored in a file for example,
and which definition is :
<<f02():int { return 25 }>>

Is is possible to have the original input stream changed to 
<<
int x=1
function f02():int {
 return 25
}
if (x < 10) then x=f02() endif
return x
>>

?

Regards,

Subject: [antlr-interest] File modification and preservation of comments
Message-ID: <cf63803e050805070353063baf@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I'm new to antlr and I was hoping to get a bit of a jumpstart from you guys.

I've got a file that's structured a bit like the following:

AAAA {
  name1 = value1
  name2 = value2
}

BBBB {
  name1 = value1a
  name2 = value2a
}

CCCC {
  A {
    ...
  }
  B  {
    ...
  }
}

(it's a bunch of blocks and sub-blocks)

I'm need to write a command-line tool that will allow a user to modify
the file (instead of having to edit the file in a text editor).

The tool might, for example, allow the user to issue a command that
would cause a new block to be added to the input file or change the
value of an attribute within the input file and then write that file
back to disk.

I'll also need to preserve any comments that may exist within the input file.

Can anyone provide me with some advice on how I should approch solving
this problem?

Thanks a million,
Ciaran

Message-ID: <200508061345.56807.marco.ladermann@gmx.de>

Hi,

I'm not sure, if the mailing list is also the bug reporting tool ...

While playing around with ANTLR3 I found the following problem in a lexer rule 
(combined grammar PGNParser.g). From the definition of a comment in the PGN 
(Portable Game Notation) for chess games:

COMMENT_STRING:
	'{'
            (  ~( '}' ) )*
	'}'
;

this is generated into the PGNParser.lexer.g file (line 24)

COMMENT_STRING : '{' (~ )* '}' ;

and this is the output from ANTLR:

ANTLR Parser Generator   Early Access Version 3.0ea5 (July 5, 2005)  1989-2005

ANTLR 2.x generates code "in order"--actions placed after a token (or rule)
to be matched generate code that is after the code for matching and AST node
construction for that token.  The "init" code is to overcome scoping
problems:  if you use syntactic predicates, actions are enclosed in
if (guessing == 0) {
	<action code>
} 

Which, of course, makes any declarations inside the if block have a scope
that is limited to the current action.  "init" code is not wrapped by an if
(guessing) {} statement and is visible throughout the rule.

So just put your "post" actions at the end of the rule (but watch out for
alternative blocks:  A | B | C { foo(); } only executes foo() if C is
matched.  ( ( A | B | C ) { foo() } executes foo after any of the
alternatives).

Terence,
 
Have you considered the idea of using Twiki for ANTLR documentation in general? A lot of the answers given out here would end up being: "See twiki page blah" and the documentation might grow naturally without any individual investing huge effort (unless they want to).

I second that too. Using a Wiki for documentation is a good idea.

We should do the same for antlr 2 doc, which is not really helpful for
the newbies.

I need two functions. One that gets two parameters, an integer and a boolean. If the boolean is true the function returns three times the integer parameter, else it returns half of the integer value. Another one is such that it takes two arguments, the previous function and an integer value as parameters  successively and returns the sum of  the parameters.

+1.

AFAIK since ANTLR is opensource, it could receive a license of the nice 
Confluence WIKI:

In fact, (sorry not to be precise) I have a SWING application with which
users can type their expressions
and I check the expression at each keystroke. So I need more precise
exceptions messages than "unexpected null".

My grammar is okay (I've used the expression part of the Java language) but
at runtime I've not enough informations.

What I would like is something like "expected '(' or ')' or '+' or '-'..."
or "expected <rule name>".

TIA,

Subject: [antlr-interest] Tree Blocks,
Message-ID: <20050808111606.AF035DC75C@www.antlr.org>

Hi,

 

It is quite common practice to introduce a virtual root node into a tree to
allow predicates and other constructs to work properly.

For instance:

 

   #( TOK_IF expr ( statement )* ( TOK_ELSE ( statement )* )? ) With this:

   #( TOK_IF expr #(BLOCK (statement)* ) ( #(BLOCK (statement)* ) ) )? )

 

Is there any good documentation on this practice?

I am a little unsure of the how's and whyfore's of this construct. Is there
some good documentation on the #BLOCK thing and how and what exactly is
meant by 

 

{#block = #([BLOCK, "block"], #block);}

 

I don't' really understand it, even though I am using it.

Does the above statement always introduce a virtual parent root node?

 

I have been told to make the change above to allow syntactic predicates to
work correctly on the if and else part of the statement, which makes sense.
I would just like to understand it better.

 

Regards

Craig

Hi,

Well, there is some documentation about manual tree construction in the
ANTLR book, but this question is asked quite frequently on this list -
maybe it should go into some kind of FAQ.

> and how and what exactly is meant by 
> {#block = #([BLOCK, "block"], #block);}

This basically means the following:
#block identifies the root of AST created by a parser rule called
"block". This of course only works if you're within a rule called block.
#( A, B, ..) is the syntax to create a subtree. It means create an AST
tree with the root A having children B (, C, D etc, if supplied).
[ASTType, "text"] means create a new AST node of type ASTType (here:
BLOCK) with the text "text", where the text part is optional. This is
actually a shorthand, it should be #[], but the # can be left away
within a #()*. 
So in summary: create an AST tree where the root node is a newly created
AST node of type BLOCK with the text "block", and as a single child
whatever is currently the AST that is being created by the block rule.
Then assign this new AST to the block rules AST.

The whole idea is that this imaginary node makes it easier to identify
expression blocks, and therefore easier (and more explicit) to match
them within later parsing steps.

HTH,
Martin

* This is btw. something I can't really understand - this shorthand only
saves one character, makes the code less obvious and leads to a lot of
irritation with newbies.

Dear PRASHANT,
Actually you are right since my question was a bit silly, but in order to make validation
by creating a grammer, I need these two functions. I looked at the examples given in antlr.
But I did not understand the parts about the function implementation.
I tried to add some functionality to the "calc" example in order to make a function that takes an expression  and an integer value as  parameters and returns the addition of these two parameters
 
 
Thanks

Hi,

I want to generate the CSV parser. Anyway, my CSV parser requires to be 
changed the delimit, quote, and row sperator. After I use the Antlr to 
generate the code, I try to modify those charater with the parameter in the 
code. However, I saw the BitSet. How can I deal with that. Is there anyway, 
we do something like JLex that we used the skeleton for those parameter 
(delimit, quote, row separator)

Thanks

Hi Jim,

We should start a Wiki, but for more of a FAQ-like creature.  For  
documentation, I'm going to write a book with draft chapters  
appearing as I write them.  Big examples etc...

A wiki we can start right away though.  Anybody want to recommend a  
simple to use, simple to install wiki, free, usable with apache?

I've used Wakka with good results, but unfortunately, that one seems to be dead. Several spinoffs have emerged, for example http://wikka.jsnx.com/HomePage , haven't tried it my self though.

MediaWiki is the software behind wikipedia and family so it's very versatile, seems to be fairly easy to install (http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki).

There's an abundance of Wiki software out there, and if we're not careful we could have a flame war on our hands :o)

I very strongly suggest that twiki is the way to go as it matches all
the criteria:

Free, open source
Loads in 10 minutes
Uses Apache
I know it works because I have been using it ;-)

http://twiki.org/

Yes - that's why Terence should pick Twiki now and be done with it ;-),
then I don't have to get confused trying to remember which twiki, sorry,
wiki, I am using ;-)

I've been using OddMuse -- http://www.oddmuse.org/cgi-bin/wiki

Very easy to install, took me about twenty minutes to get it running,
another hour or two of installing modules for formatting and more
comprehensive wiki syntax.

The author answered my questions quickly too.

Well, I haven't used that one, but twiki has all those plug-ins too and
it only took 10 minutes to install... ;-) 

As a last gasp attempt to influence the use of twiki over anything else,
I would refer to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_software

Twiki is a collaborative development, blah, blah...

Best thing to do is just to pick one and start it I think.

If all you really want is a community FAQ, you could try FAQOMATIC 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/faqomatic/

It is a set of Perl scripts that run as a cgi.

Hi there

> If all you really want is a community FAQ, you could try FAQOMATIC 

I'd recommend a wiki instead, much more flexible, and gives the community the choice to create what documentation is needed. Some of it might benefit your book also :o) * also, you can do all that FAQ-O-Matic (and similar beasts) can do with a wiki.

For a good wiki (content-wise), see for example http://wiki.wxpython.org/.

Message-ID: <6200.194.237.142.21.1123579111.squirrel@www.scorpiondata.com>

Hi,

I've been trying for quite a while now to get my lexer to handle unknown
chars (report error, ignore char, resume lexing for new token). I've now
managed to implement something that achieves this but I had to resort to a
little semi-ugly hack.

For the record, I'm using the latest version of the ANTLR plugin for
Eclipse. Atleast when I use the Eclipse update site feature it says I
already got the latest version. I couldn't really tell exactly which
version this is, but this is what the version info in Eclipse look like
currently:

  http://mnemo.minimum.se/screens/version_box.png

Anyway, back to the matter at hand. From the ANTLR docs, it seemed like
the default error handling would do exactly what I needed. Which I assume
also means that defaultErrorHandler is implicitly set to true when not
specified, correct? Anyway, I looked at the lexer source and saw that the
lexer did NOT do what the docs said, instead it did raise an exception
which when propagated to the parser would cause the entire lex/parse
process to stop. So I tried to set defaultErrorHandler to true in the
lexer options, generated the lexer and parser and boom, now the lexer was
full of errors. It said "missing method recover()". Now the error handling
started to look more like what I actually wanted, it reported and error
and then called recover() just like in the parser. So my hack was to add a
dummy method called recover() with the right params, and then have this
method so nothing at all. This silenced the errors and the code works, but
it feels rather ugly.

Unfortunately my current code is closed-source proprietary so I cannot
attach the .g file here even though I understand that this would help
reproduce the error etc.

So, the big question is; why does ANTLR generate broken code? Is this
fixed in cvs? Or, is it not an ANTLR problem at all? Maybe it's a problem
with the Eclipse ANTLR plugin?

I've tried to contact the ANTLR Eclipse plugin author too (hi again if
you're on this list too ;D).

What do you make of this?

martin

I'm looking for a good reference on strategy to support and implement
function overloading (same name, different argument lists).  Those
I've seen are either weak on the subject, or treat it as a solved
problem.

I can plow ahead with what I have, but it just doesn't feel elegant -
and I'm reinventing the wheel.

Any suggestions?

Exactly what kind of a suggestion you need.

Surely as you probably already know the easiest way is to keep a list
of all the functions tha begin with the same name, and assign them
different ids internally based on their args.
When the function is actually called, first get the name and then
depending on the args put the call to the approrpiate function.

But i guess you already know this.
So what exactly are you looking for?

Looks like you do have the latest plugin.
Is there any way you can create a dummy sample that reproduces the error?

I doubt it's something specific to the antlr-eclipse plugin; could you test
against the 2.7.5 antlr from antlr.org as well to see if it has the problem.

Thanks,

The lexer is supposed to do that. Read the doc on error handling. The
lexer needs to inform the parser when something gets screwed up in the
input stream.

This has nothing to do with the antlr eclipse plugin.
It seems to be a bug in the code gen. The recover() method is used
inside the parser.
The lexer as such i dont think can recover the lexing of the same
token. if something screws up, it will just skip that char to find the
next token.

Seeing this I believe the defaultErrorHandler option should be
disallowed for lexer rules.

As a hint , you can look at override the reportError() method of the parser,
or provide custom error handlers for each rule.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Leaks in doubly-linked trees: implementing
	'getParent'
Message-ID: <42F89769.6030404@cyconix.com>

Some time ago there was a discussion about the need to occasionally look 
up trees to find your current context (starting at
<http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2005-June/012822.html>, 
through the threading on the website doesn't work well).

There was a school of thought that this is important in some situations, 
and that it should be implemented with 'getParent', and over-riding 
various other methods, which I suspect various people have done 
independently (including myself).

However, there's a problem with the obvious implementation, which is:

class myAST : public antlr::CommonAST {
private:
  RefAST up;                //!< Parent node
...
};

The problem is that this leaks. The assignment 'up = parent' will 
increase the parent's reference count. The problem comes when you 
attempt to delete a branch of a tree:

  // remove oldnode and its descendents, replace with newnode
  newnode->setNextSibling(oldnode->getNextSibling());
  previous->setNextSibling(newnode); // orphans oldnode

This orphans oldnode, but it won't delete it since the 'setNextSibling' 
op doesn't reduce its reference count to zero (because oldnode's 
children still reference it).

Does anyone have a bidirectional tree implementation that avoids this 
problem? At first sight, one obvious fix may be to modify the library 
code so that the reference count decrementing routines ignore references 
from children.

Ok here's what I did. First, I went through my entire grammar and remove
all actions, rule parameters and so on. then I started to remove half the
parser rules, then another half and so on. Same with lexer rules. The
error persists and now I'm down to this simple snippet:

http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/J3zpEg47.html
(another copy of the .g file below, incase the paste site expires)

And I can reproduce the problem using the ANTLR command line tool too
(2.7.5 version 20050201). Maybe this is a problem in my .g syntax, but it
seems odd that ANTLR generates broken code without warning.. :/

Having no defaultErrorHandler option specified at all makes my lexer stop
lexing whenever it runs into a char that is not part of any rule. Having
set defaultErrorHandler=false gives the same result. However, setting
defaultErrorHandler=true and implementing a dummy method recover() in the
lexer get's the job done. Having the dummy method feels ugly though, and
just as you say I also believe that this might be a code generation bug of
some sort.

However, I don't believe just removing defaultErrorHandler would solve all
problems (not mine atleast). I think, the lexer error handling needs to be
implemented so that it does what it suppose to do accoring to docs, ie it
should not stop lexing/parsing when it runs into obscure unknown chars.

That's my $0.02 =)

Sorry about my previous message that not clear :(

I want to build the CSV parser. The delimiter, text qualifier and row 
separator must be changable during runtime. Anyway, I was really new to 
Antlr. I am sure how can I do that.

class CSVLexer extends Lexer;
options { k = 1; charVocabulary = '\1'..'\377'; } 

WITHINQUOTE : ('"'(~'"')* '"')+ ;
WITHOUTQUOTE : ( ~( ',' | '\r' | '\n' | '"' ) ( ~( ',' | '\r' | '\n' ) )* );
EOL : ( '\n' | '\r' ) {newline();};
DELIM : ',' ; 

After I use antlr.Tool to generate the parser, how can I change the ',' to 
some thing else such as Tab delimit without to regenerate the parser by the 
antlr.Tool.

Ahh.  Caffeine. 

Thanks, Prashant.

Perhaps I'm looking for something that doesn't exist because it is so
obvious ;-)  Yes, I've already done that part.  The problem I'm having
is more in resolving function calls, and in in-lining the functions --
tieing arguments to parameters in the body of the function.

A rule like this is implemented in the generated code as a simple loop
so by itself this rule cannot trigger of out of memory situations (at
least I'd be genuinely suprised...).

It would be helpfull to try and see what happens if you generate the
lexer with tracing on (my guess is that it's recursing somewhere (maybe
some rules that can match nothing?)). Target language and how your
lexer/parser is initialized is also helpfull. Is the lexer by itself
also generating out  of memory errors (if you call it from a simple
loop) or is it only happening hooked up to the parser?

> splicing in one final newline?

For a lexer eof needs (in general) no extra handling unless you're
dealing with tokenstreams and such (sometimes you have to override the
uponEOF method for eof cleanups) In some cases you can also look (in
action code) explicitly at the current token and detect EOF for better
error handling like in this nested C comment rule:

C_COMMENT options { paraphrase = "'C-comment'"; }
{
   unsigned int nstarts = 0;  // keep track of nesting level..
}:
   '/' { $setType(DIV); }
   ( '*' { $setType(antlr::Token::SKIP); nstarts++; }
    ( {
	if( LA(1) == EOF || LA(2) == EOF )
	   throw antlr::RecognitionException("Unclosed comment",
                   getFilename(),
                   inputState->tokenStartLine,
                   inputState->tokenStartColumn );
       }:
        { (nstarts > 1) || (LA(2) != '/') }? '*'
	  {
             if(LA(1) == '/')
                nstarts--;
          }
          | '\n' { newline(); }
          | '\r'
          | '\t' { tab(); }
          | "/*" { nstarts++; }
          | ~('*'|'\n'|'\r'|'\t')
    )*
    "*/"
   )?
;

Ric

In general you can't do this with antlr, or be prepared for insane
ambiguities. The generated bitsets are all final, and some checks are
done with if's depending on codegeneration settings. So changing bitsets
between runs is also not an option (and if you do you have no way to
know if you'll introduce ambiguities). If the separators are in a
limited set you could maybe adapt your grammar to accomodate it and then
use predicates to force the right delimiter.

Cheers,

Ric

Anyone?

Hi Bryan,

if I understood you right, why don't you use somekind of vtable?
meaning that each signature of your functions has a particular index.
This is how it is done in c++, where each class has a vtable.
In-lining "virtual" functions is of course a problem - since you may
have a unknown class.
In this case class flattening might be a good choice.
(http://www.l4ka.org/publications/2004/dannowski04managing.pdf)

Hope I did help more than confuse :-)

Sebastian.

Martin,
  Could you please file a bug report for this at -
http://www.antlr.org/misc/feedback
so that this can be looked into and corrected for the future versions of antlr.

Bryan,

How about the c++ scheme, which ties the function
signature to the return type and the types of the
parameters (mangling/demangling)?  See g++ code, gdb
code, probably others but you can check the website.

<pedantic>
C++ doesn't actually consider the return type.
</pedantic>

I have a scheme where the number of formal parameters is appended to the 
function name to give a signature for the symbol table lookup. This 
handles pretty much all the complexity required for overloading in my 
case, but it's a pretty simple language.

The c++/g++ is considerably more complicated -- the
types of all the parameters are encoded -- take a look
at the GNUcode for c++filt ( part of binutils) or gcc
itself.

Ok, so Ahmed and Prashant...you guys seem to know confluence, can you  
get us started?  Here is the landing page it gave me after I  
installed (was trivial!):

http://www.antlr.org/confluence/display/ds/Confluence+Overview

Can u folks create your own accounts or do I need to do that?

So what we need is some organization etc...  How do we create an  
overall "scope" that is ANTLR and then have, perhaps, ANTLR 2, ANTLR  
3 etc...?  THen within, we need "scopes" for tools, faqs, examples,  
etc... I'll need one for stringtemplate too i guess.

Is a "scope" a new wiki or just part of a larger hierarchy?

We have one month to eval.  If we liki (play on wiki) then I will  
emaili them for an open-source licensi ;)

Thanks,
Ter

It autologged me in when I gave it my details. It also lets me login 
later. It just doesn't let me do anything after that. It says I don't 
have any permissions.

Ok, I just set it so that users can add spaces etc...

Also, allowing anonymous users to browse now.

I have to run to the eye doctor...poke around and let me know what ya  
think.  I'll be back in a couple of hours.

Seems like a cool system so far.  I just installed mysql on the antlr  
box so we can transition to that if we liki :)  Apparently the HSQL  
default DB is not reliable.

I was more hoping for a reference than a specific discussion of
solutions (should have known better ;-)

I know g++ must do something clever; however, I've avoided that code
because I don't want to end up with something that derives from a
GPL'ed beastie.

The language I'm supporting has:
(1) overloaded functions // C++-like
(2) defaulted parameters in the prototypes // C++-like
(3) uses return type as part of overloading // ugh.
(4) allows name/value pairs in function calls // ugh.

So, given a function
   F(a: integer, b:integer = 10)

the goal is for all these to be allowed, and call this function:
   F(1);
   F(1,3);
   F(1, b=3);
   F(a=1, b=3);
   F(b=3, a=1);

I'm doing name-mangling, but it seems that the number of symbols
managed for each function is exploding on me because of the allowed
name/value pairs in function calls - it smells funny, if you will.

Since it smells funny, I was asking for general references on how to
do function overloading, etc.  Some compiler texts ignore overloading;
others treat it as an uninteresting problem or start with "now that
you have the AST..."

Next stop, http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/

Clive,

I'm resending this to the list, as I'm a C++ jock myself, and came to
ANTRL party later (2.7.3 was the first version I used).

Can anyone give guidance to Clive on 2.5.5 -> 2.7.5 migration?

The following link is a good starting point:
http://www.antlr.org/doc/getting-started.html

Really it is just downloading the distribution and grabbing the 
antlr.jar out of it, placing it wherever you want, and then making sure 
that that jar is in your CLASSPATH. Then you can run "java antlr.Tool". 
If you are concerned with breaking your current CLASSPATH, you can do:
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/path/to/antlr.jar

Best,
Chris

Hi Scott,

Before i get hit with school starting, i should get 2.7.6 out.  Can  
you send me your final changes?  Ideally, I'd get a zip of all new  
and all changed files (only).  That way I can compare to the notes  
you and I made over the phone and then incorporate and push. :)

Do you have a simple general changelist I can add to my changelist?

So should we link in the mail archive somehow beyond just a link?

Ok, I may have answered my own question: we can have confluence pull  
from a POP account (which would be subscribed to the lists).

Question is therefore: should we?  Might get better search facilities  
this way.

Howdy,

Figured out how to make

available for anonymous users.  Anon will be able to read and export  
but not post comments, which should prevent spam.

I like confluence so far. :)  I just asked for an open-source license :)

I vote yes to this. Also, does ANTLR 3.0EA4 come with an automatic rule
to parse email yet , or do we still have to write our own grammar as per

I'm still trying to figure that out.  I go to the "set up smtp  
server" section and it asks me for a "From" address.  What the hell  
is that!  Must be the generic "admin return address".  Anyway, I get  
some MIME error from java: doesn't know text/plain. :(

Sounds good to me for now...i still haven't figured out what I'll do  
for bugs for antlr 3.  Just finished the new StringTemplate site;  
hopefully will get a wiki going soon too. (ok, just got it running).

I guess it is looking for some generic address to use when sending
emails about passwords and so on. I would think that /dev/null@antrl.org
is best unless you want to get lots of emails complaining that the
password reset did not work ;-)

So, I am trying to get the software to email out and so I asked for

didn't send it.  I can't log in now and I don't have my password.   
I'm pretty sure, this is not a very smart approach.  I *asked* for my  
passwd not a reset.  The page says "send it to me".

So, we're screwed.  We have no admin capability.  Ugh.

Well, I need to get it working with MySQL anyway, so maybe I'll just  
reinstall and try to get it at wiki.antlr.org while I'm at it.  Can't  
do now as I have to leave for the day; maybe tomorrow.

Note that I"m out of town (w/o laptop) from tomorrow after lunch  
until Monday night.  So, no email I don't think.

Not suprisingly Confluence has it's own tag language.

I can't help but note that had all the docs been in some adequate semantic
XML format (e.g. DocBook) it would be relatively easy to cook up some XSLT
to reproduce the docs in Confluence.

Is this possible with TML without much lasting damage to one's already
dwindling follicular reserves?

PS	Kunle did reproduce the CSharp Runtime doc manually just to see what
Confluence has to offer. He reports much pain (as is typically of such
manual tasks) but, results are very pleasing to the eyes.

Yup.  It was started before XML though.  Yep, been that long.

I was thinking of that and had started converting to TML earlier...

For the "real" doc (i.e., the ANTLR v3 book) I was going to use latex.

Hooray!  I wonder if emacs and some rexpr could help.

Are you saying that it is possible (and relatively painless to tranform TML
to <other-tag-language>)?. Do you have any such tools ready built?

> For the "real" doc (i.e., the ANTLR v3 book) I was going to use latex.

What's the advantage (if any) over XML?. I haven't used TeX in any
significantly angry manner since I discovered Word/PageMaker  ;-)

Perhaps but, it's all come to nought anyway. 

With the admin passwd reset issue and  the inevitable(??) loss of all
existing content, noone will ever get to see it and, I doubt he'll be
willing to repeat a manual conversion. 

Fun and games. Oh, the joys...

XML is not a natural documentation language. Its ok when you have a GUI
in between generating XML files, but otherwise its cumbersome to edit
for extended periods or large documents.

LaTeX is heaven. Its like programming your papers which is more natural
than WYSIWYG.

As long as we're on that subject, might I point out Trac (http://www.edgewall.com/trac/). It is a combined wiki, a bug tracker and source control frontend. The major benefit is easy crosslinking between bug reports/issues, source code and the wiki.

And, the source is open and quite simple (writtend in Python) which makes modifications easy. If Confluence is anything like Atlassian Jira, extensions and source modifications require a lot of work.

Yes, but by now there are really nice pseudo/half WYSIWYG XML editors,
especially for DocBook. There are even editors which can be used by non
technical (or less technical) people, in contrast to LaTeX. LyX doesn't
count, it gives you the cumbersome customization of LaTeX combined with
the weak features, clumsiness and sometimes even unstability of MS Word.

Well, it surely is quite close to heaven iif the recipient of your
document supplied a LaTeX style, or you can choose yourself and like the
given style.

In any other case you'll have to change the appearance using that macro
processor language from hell, or even worse fiddle around with BibTeX.
Ugh.

I would always prefer DocBook (less work) or maybe DITA (more work, but
easier to customize) over it - changing stylesheets is quite easy and
you've got nice semantic markup that can be transformed into any target
format (CHM!).

Subject: [antlr-interest] Non-reserved keywords (again)
Message-ID: <20050810131516.GA4145@dragon.homelinux.org>

Greetings,

I have search long and far to see if anyone had had the same problem I'm
having with a language that does not reserve keywords, like SQL and in
my case Fortran. I have found many people with the problem, yet no
useful solutions. The two main ones I found were

http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=140
and
http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2002-June/001486.html

I have no idea how to execute the first one, that is create a custom
token class and have ANTLR actually use it.

And the second one completely breaks the parser, introducing fatal
non-determinism which I am very reluctant to address.

Has anyone come up with a better solution? Does the latest ANTLR 3.0
preview solve my problem? Will it?

Thank you,

Subject: [antlr-interest] Confluence Status!
Message-ID: <ddcv7q$rpn$1@sea.gmane.org>

Hi,

I'm not a Confluence expert - just a user, but I had so far
no problems with it.

For me, the ANRLR confluence worked:
- I signed up - worked
- changed my password - worked
- I added a space(ANTLR) - worked
- Added test page and test news - worked.
- (re)Edit created page - worked.
- add comment - worked.
- Made them visible to anonymous(I think there's no need for more) - worked.

So from a user perspective it looks everything OK.

So folks:
- what do we need more at the moment?
- what's the problem?
- why do you want to install something else when this works and the 
install work was already done?

Of course, I haven't tested the admin features cause I have no admin rights.

IMHO, if there are some admin problems, you should ask by Atlassian. 
They are very helpful (at least that was our experience).

Ahmed.

Subject: [antlr-interest] linear list from tree
Message-ID: <186d86105081006362b10b63d@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to build a linear list made from the 'expr' which are
spread over a tree.
The following grammer fragment does not work.
So how to do it?

Thanks,
marc

output should be:
#( ARRAYIN e1_1 e1_2 e1_3 ...)
// _1, _2 ... loop number


arrayindex_list!
    : ( #(ARRAYIX
                ( ALL
                | ( e1:expr // 0 or 2
                        {
                                      #arrayindex_list = #( NULL,
(arrayindex_list),e1);
// also not working:        #arrayindex_list = #( arrayindex_list,e1);
//                                    #arrayindex_list = #(
(arrayindex_list),e1);


                        }

Search through the example code, there should be one that does this.  If
not, I know the C parser does.

You may also get some mileage out of my parser filter approach.  See

ANTLR 3 will be way easier dealing with unreserved keywords.  I doubt if
the latest preview is stable enough for real use yet.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Using antlr to add new fields to java source based
	on a template file
Message-ID: <7A0ACACC56178C459767C637BCAE2C11BA3A38@mail.summuslan.com>

Hello all, I am doing a little research trying to find a tool to perform
a task at my office and I think antlr and StringTemplate may contain the
solution I am looking for. 

 

What I am looking for specifically is a program that can open a java
source file, analyze its structure (basically enumerate the fields and
methods) and then load in a second java file and make sure that it
contains all the same fields, methods and if it doesn't to fill them in
with the values from the template file. Is this something that Antlr can
handle natively or is it something I would need to custom write? Or is
there already a tool out there that can do this?

 

Thanks for any pointers you guys can give me.

It's certainly a step, but bugzilla takes quite a bit more faffing
around than just installing MySql, though it is very likely worth it.

I don't think anyone does want to install something else, just get this
one working. At the end of the day it s just whatever Terence wants to
install and look after. I am just happy that the idea of getting a wiki
going was taken up and will be happy to contribute once Confluence lets
me in (or rather Terence says it is good to start using AND I can log

A java grammar is distributed with antlr(examples\java\java folder), it easy to set it up and the awt
tree viewer will help a lot.
And AST can be compared easily as well.

Hi.  I've decided on Confluence but I'll need some time to set it up  
for real.  I'm leaving on a plane today for 5 days but have decided  
to bring the ol' laptop.  I may get something done on vacation.

Yep, I'm going to stick with confluence.  We can play with existing  
now, but I've lost the admin password and also want to reinstall to  
use mysql not their internal thing.

We can easily export still...no worries.  Uh, wait a minute.  how  
come I can't see the freaking spaces anymore.  All I get is ANTLR 3!!!

Prashant or anybody: can you tell me what happened to the spaces we

We had one for ANTLR 2, v3, and StringTemplate but I don't see them  
now.  Anybody know why?

For one, I can't log in, but I set them up to be visible to  
anonymous, which I checked yesterday.

That seems to be the issue.  I tried to start one for stringtemplate,  
but it's initialized to use the same data dir!  Oops.

Sorry, that should read iteration number.
Inspired by Bryan's reply I got it working, but a general question remains:

How to append something to the actual list, within a loop?

ie.

rule!
:  (#(A e:expr (ee:expr)?) 
)+

output should be something like:

(e1 ee1 e2 e3 ee3 e4 ...)

the numbers are again denote the interation number

I don't think there are a project to build the "ASTFrame library". The
ASTFrame class is currently included in the build. So you don't really
need to rebuild anything. Just reference the assembly and use the
namespace to access to that class.

Subject: [antlr-interest] hierarchy of lexers and parsers
Message-ID: <20050811131338.B8BFD240008F@mwinf1002.wanadoo.fr>

Hello,

I've just started using ANTLR and I have a question I hope can be answered
on the list.

My input is a string which contains some tags (anything within angle
brackets) and some logic code (anything within square brackets) embedded in
regular text. I would like to have a primary lexer that recognizes three
token types: TEXT, TAG and CODE. When the primary parser encounters a token
of type CODE while generating the AST, I would like it to pass that token to
a secondary (lexer,parser) pair that will be in charge of building the
(sub)AST.

I believe this can be achieved by using token streams but so far, I haven't
found a convenient solution.

Thanks in advance,
Thierry

I got this from another list - forwarding because ANTLR is one of the

One solution is usually to use a stateful lexer, e.g. if you have a
keyword called "if" that may also be an identifier you have to keep
track in the lexer if your in a place where an identifier or where a
keyword should be lexed. Every lexed token then moves the lexer into
another state. That can be quite cumbersome (the XQuery spec for example
provides a lexer automaton that has over 16 states, most of them with
well over 10 different actions), but usually leads to something usable.

The second advise you found probably works too, but you might need to
use a lot of syntatic predicates.

Hello

I have to adapt an existing grammar but I'm new to the topic of grammars, so I 
could use some advice.

In my grammar, there are several rules with actions. The rules allow empty 
matches, and as it is, the actions get executed even if it was an empty 
match. I have to modify the rules, so that the actions get only executed if 
the match is not empty.
I think I have modified the rules correctly, but would be grateful if anybody 
could check if my modifications make sense:

< original version
> modified version

---------------------------------------
< rulename : ( rule )?
<              { actions; }
<          ;

> rulename : ( rule

>          ;

---------------------------------------
< rulename : ( rule1 )? ( rule2 )?
<              { actions; }
<          ;

>              ( rule1 { doit = true; } )?
>              ( rule2 { doit = true; } )?

This is correct, but to me the next approach sounds better:

> rulename : { boolean doit = false; }
>          ( rules {doit=true;} )*
>          { if(doit) {actions;} }

It's like the last rule you show, and I find it clearer.

Thanks for your answer!
You're right, the readability is better in the variant with the boolean.
I'll take that in account for my future work.

Readability is subjective, certainly, but it seems that the ANTLR-only
version is clearer because it's using ANTLR to control flow, rather
than requiring action blocks to do something that is built into the
ANTLR language - something that you must already know if using
ANTLR....

But that's just me :-)

If there is one word to describe me,
that word would have to be "profectionist".
Any form of incompitence is an athema to me.
Metathesis??? Don't ax me.
Just between you and I, the grammar used by Americans are getting worse.
It just ceases to amaze me how that could be the case, but mostly I

You have a good point! It was quite a bit work to convert the grammar from c 
to java (at least for one like me who knows no antlr nor c). That should 
teach me to keep the grammar as language independent as possible. Maybe the 
best alternative would be using only antlr constructs if possible, and if the 
readability is not that good, just write an explanation in a comment

That's weird, because I didn't receive this answer in my mail. Is
there any problem with the list, or it's my fault? Anyway, you're
welcome, Daniel :)

Sure, readability is subjective. But you're using actions anyway, and
I find the ()* construction more readable than the (()+)? one. That's
why I choose the former. Maybe using only ANTLR language it's more
elegant. But, again, each to his own ;)

and I guess I fall in-between these. to me:

rule1 : ( rule2 )? ;
rule2 : ( rule3 ... )+ { action;... }

is clearer.

no flags. 
avoids (directly) the (to me) confusing ((x)+)? construct.
the ((x)+)? is still there but is split across two rules.

just my 2cents...

that makes sense.
But there's a reason why I'm not gonna do it like this with the current 
grammar: I'm not writing a new grammar, but adapting an existing one 
(actually the ada grammar from Oliver Kellogg). I try to change as few as 
possible and I'm surely not gonna do funky modifications, at least not until 
I'm no antlr newbie anymore ;)

Thanks for all your answers and good night

Well, there are always ways to get commercial software for free :D

I've done something similar to what you need (but used # for starting
expression), but it was a hand coded lexer and parsers. 
It's part of my code templates open source project. You can download it from

Subject: [antlr-interest] hierarchy of lexers and parsers

Hello,

I've just started using ANTLR and I have a question I hope can be answered
on the list.

My input is a string which contains some tags (anything within angle
brackets) and some logic code (anything within square brackets) embedded in
regular text. I would like to have a primary lexer that recognizes three
token types: TEXT, TAG and CODE. When the primary parser encounters a token
of type CODE while generating the AST, I would like it to pass that token to
a secondary (lexer,parser) pair that will be in charge of building the
(sub)AST.

I believe this can be achieved by using token streams but so far, I haven't
found a convenient solution.

Thanks in advance,
Thierry

unfourtunately this didn't work for me. The tree structure is ok, but it
gives me a different column value for the WITH_CLAUSE node (it gets the
same column value like the first node of the c_name_list)

Thanks anyway

Subject: [antlr-interest] using VC++6 to compile antlr in a static library
Message-ID: <42D7AA4700044B46@mail-5.mail.tiscali.sys>

Hi all,
I'm currently using antlr for a little parser and I wanted to compile it
using VC++6. I tried to look for any kind of information about it but what
I found wasn't very usefull (maybe I didn't look for in the correct place...)

So I changed (a little bit) the source code of antlr by myself, in order
to make it available for compiling on VC++6. Now I have a VC++6 project compiling
antlr in a static library that can be linked from other VC++6 projects which
need antlr. My changes are not invasive and, obviously, the sources can be
compiled under linux (I've tried on Red Hat).

I believe it could be usefull for someone who, like me, need this feature.
What do you think about it? could I post my sources? where?

Thanks,
Ale

How about #arrayindex_list = #(NULL, arrayindex_list,e1); ?

Message-ID: <42FCD4A9.7040003@gmx.de>



Hello

I am just wondering about the bogus getLine() getColumn() Implementation in
BaseAST (not overwritten in any subtype)


    public int getLine() {
        return 0;
    }

    public int getColumn() {
        return 0;
    }

Okay, in most cases you don't care about line numbers but in my case I do.
So what is the reason for this?! Do I miss anything?

I simply assumed I could pick up that information in the parse tree??

Regards
Georg

Hi.  These days I store the token object in the AST and then override  
those methods to pull from the token.

The University has seen fit to kill the power frequently to my office  
as they repair the roof (no I don't know why).  And this very second  
(and last week) I've been trying to get the wiki thing up.  Sorry for  
the inconvenience!  I waited until Saturday hoping people were not  
using the site. ;)

Oh, and I got a UPS to prevent more issues with the university's  
power.  I will hook it up when I return from "vacation" Monday.

Hello,

?

I'm writing a tree walker and I try my tree walker modify an expresion:
function(arg1, arg2, arg3) to function('arg1','arg2','arg3') but I don't
know, how I can do it.

?

I tried to add a node QUOT (='\'') after a current node equal "("?and ","
and before ")" and "," but I can't find a method which can insert a node
between current and next node.

?

Thank you for every advise.

Message-ID: <200508151203.j7FC36GX011732@rgmgw3.us.oracle.com>

I have a grammar for one version of SQL that I'm mapping into Oracle SQL.
We can walk the trees and generate what we need to however,  I have a full version of the target grammar available.  Is is possible to map from one grammar to another, so that it is possible to verify that tree n is correct wrt the target grammar as shown below.  

|Source Grammar |  tree 1 | ... | tree n | Target grammar|
|    o          |    o    |     |    o   |       o       |
|   / \         |   / \   |     |   / \  |      / \      |
|  o   o        |  o   o  |     |  o   o |     o   o     |
|     / \       | /     \ |     | / \    |    / \        |
|    o   o      |o       o|     |o   o   |   o   o       |

Today, we can walk the source tree and make transformations to it to move us from tree 1 towards tree n, but when do we know we're finished and correct? I'm not looking for a specific solution, but rather some ideas about how this can be done efficiently if at all :-)
Thanks guys

Hi,

I've the following lexer rules :

RG            : '\u00bb';

It scans

'>> Bla text <<' => TEXT , EOF
'>>'                   => RG, EOF

but cannot scan
'>>    '            
I want the scanner to evaluate to RG, WS (which is skipped), EOF
But it stucks in the TEXT rule : "line 1:5: expecting '?', found '<EOF>'"

Can someone give me a hint?

I'm taking a stab in two directions here - hope one of them is correct :-)

If you're talking about tracking which parts of the tree are complete,
you can use a marker in the AST to know which version a specific node
is.  E.g.
    blah: #(op:AAA b c d) { ... #op->level++; };

If you're talking about testing/validating your translator, you could
output your result then attempt to compile it with the "official"
interpreter.  Something like this, from the command line:
   # given test_xxx.in, convert to test_xxx.res, then compile it...
   myConvert -o test_xxx.res test_xxx.in > test_xxx.out 2> test_xxx.err
   officialCompile test_xxx.res > test_xxx.oc_out 2> test_xxx.oc_err
The input file, and each of the four output files can be stored for
reference and reuse; once you have a solid baseline, you can eliminate
the officialCompile testing from routine regression testing - but make
sure it's still used regularly.

My unicode knowledge is rather weak, sorry.

But doesn't your VOCAB lexer rule include WS and NOT skip WS? (WS -
e.g. blank - is '\u0040' right?)

Hope this helps...

I don't understand the question.  You talk about tree walker, but then
ask a question (I think) about scanner/lex operations.

If you are processing a tree of:

   #(FUNC function a1 a2 ... )

you can do something like this to add the intermediate node:

   a: #(FUNC nm ( arg )* );
   arg: old_arg { ## = #( #[QUOTE,"'"], ##); };

---------

If you are attempting to change the sequence of tokens scanned from

   NAME LEFTPAREN NAME COMMA NAME ... RIGHTPAREN

into

   NAME LEFTPAREN QUOTE NAME QUOTE COMMA ... QUOTE RIGHTPAREN

Then I'll have to leave it for others, as I don't use an antlr lexer...

To test the transformations done by a certain pass, I would run the  
result tree through a basic tree grammar with no actions in it, just  
to make sure it was still grammatically valid.  I structured all of  
my transformations to conform to a "super" grammar which was really  
the union of the input tree grammar and the output tree grammar.   
That's impossible to do with a regular grammar, but with a tree  
grammar it is quite convenient.  All you have to do is make sure that  
each language uses it's own unique token types.

As far as knowing you are finished and correct, write tests!  For  
each mini translation you do, write a complete example program and  
what you expect upon output.  Write a test program to do your  
transformation and diff the result of that against what you expect.   
It's really handy and important to do, because it's so easy to change  
something in one place and see the effect of it somewhere else when  
you are dealing with grammars.

By the way, I'm an ANTLR consultant and could give much more in depth  
advice if you hire me.  Also come to the ANTLR conference this year.   
I'll be there, as will many other experts, and we just sit around and  
complain until someone smarter comes up with a good solution :)

Sorry I think I still have an error, I think that as written above the
setType action will only happen on the second alt inside the ()? you
could test that theory by trying the string "RG  LG" as a test...

Need to add, I think, another set of grouping ()'s:

TERMINATING_RG:
  RG ( WS )* ( ( LG | ( VOCAB ( VOCAB | WS )* LG ) ) { $setType(TEXT); } )?
;

Howdy,

I've got the confluence-based antlr/StringTemplate wikis up:

http://www.antlr.org/wiki/

As an anonymous user you can view but that's it.  If you want to add  
or edit or comment etc... you must have register.  We have a 200 user  
limit; when we hit the limit, I'll deactivate people that have been  
inactive for a while so don't worry about wasting a user. ;)

It is connected to mysql (which I'll need to figure out how to  
backup) and the smtp server seems to be working with it as well.

Later I will probably add JIRA usage.  :)

So, add as you can.  Please do not create any new wiki spaces; just  
add pages.  *THINK* before adding things as it may be hard to  
reorganize once things have been created.  Think about the  
organization etc..

Ok, now I turn my attention to release 2.7.6....

Nice :).

Well, what should an anonymous user do more anyway? :)

> It is connected to mysql (which I'll need to figure out how to  backup) 
Doesn't have Confluence an "Export"/"Backup" function? (or that was 
JIRA?  :) ). If not, than mysql has it's own export tool and it can be 
started from cron - the only thing required is to find out the right 
parameters :).

Maybe a simple idea:
The organization is not a problem if one is making an index(from the 
space main page) for those pages. Later one still can reorder that 
index, or give it a 'tree' like structure.

What's more important is that the content of the pages is well 
formatted, and easy to read :).

Ahmed.

Hi,

due to linear approximate lookahead the following grammar gives a
non-determinism warning:

a: z S P;
b: z T Q;
z: P (T P)*;

because z can be followed by (T Q | S P) which leads to a possible T P
in the approximation.

How can I resolve this, besides pasting z into a and b rules? Sorry, if
this has been asked before.

Thanks,

Well, there's a 'printer' button in to right upper conrner. That button 
will apply a different 'decorator' over the page. That page is nice 
enough to be printed or used with with OpenOffice (than save as PDF).

Wait, - even better:

Now I saw that if one is logged in, near the 'printer' button, there's a 
PDF button too :) . The generated PDF looks very good :) (now I think I 
love this software :) ).

Maybe it's a good idea to take the 'feature tour', cause it seems that 
they implemented lot's of small gems :) :

If I remember correctly, Terence said that he generally gets bit by this 
problem at least once per real grammar. The pasting of z into a and b 
will only work in this case because a and b are top level rules. I added

x: a | b;

and generated this code

try {      // for error handling
	if ((LA(1)==LITERAL_P) && (LA(2)==LITERAL_T||LA(2)==LITERAL_S))
	{
		a();
		astFactory.addASTChild(currentAST, returnAST);
		x_AST = (AST)currentAST.root;
	}
	else if ((LA(1)==LITERAL_P) && (LA(2)==LITERAL_T))
	{
		b();
		astFactory.addASTChild(currentAST, returnAST);
		x_AST = (AST)currentAST.root;
	}
	else
	{
		throw new NoViableAltException(LT(1), getFilename());
	}
			
}

as you can see you can't get to rule 'b';

At least this should be fixed in Antlr 3 which handles LL(*)

Coming in rather late ...

We really want some sort of "anti spamming" system if we have a wiki.
There's a couple of simple solutions. As an example, go to
www.pickwiki.com. You need an admin password to edit pages, and there's
a great big hint staring you in the face when you go to signup/login.
Anybody who knows anything about Pick will guess the password in ten
seconds flat.

Just do something along the lines of "Admin password? How does the
author of Antlr sign his emails". Or "What's Antlr's author's surname".
Something that anybody who knows anything about Antlr should know
without needing to think.

Cheers,
Wol

Hi Jim,

We should start a Wiki, but for more of a FAQ-like creature.  For  
documentation, I'm going to write a book with draft chapters  
appearing as I write them.  Big examples etc...

A wiki we can start right away though.  Anybody want to recommend a  
simple to use, simple to install wiki, free, usable with apache?

Hi

I installed the antlr distribution from antlr-2.7.5.msi. All files from examples
have the UNIX end of line instead of the DOS end of line.

Very nice software and good support so far.  And of course very nice

Hi.  I've done this for antlr's contact and submit section and for  
the wiki you have to register which is usually not easy automatically  
and certainly has to have smarter software.  In people's experience,  
does this generally prevent spam comments?

Hi Mike.  Confluence has an email archiver; example:

http://www.antlr.org/wiki/spaces/viewmailarchive.action?key=ds

Anybody object to me putting antlr and stringtemplate interest into  
separate lists?  Confluence will make it searchable etc... :)

Hi,

Just a reminder that the workshop is being held again this year  
(hosted / cosponsored by BEA systems) here in San Francisco:

http://www.cs.usfca.edu/ANTLR2005.shtml

We are about half full already so starting thinking about signing up  
if you are planning on coming.  Only 35 people will fit in the room.

It will be lots of fun; very informal, but full of info.  Lots of  
ANTLR users just talking about their projects and me talking about  
various applications and future stuff.  I'm even trying to get  
Eclipse to send people to talk about ANTLR use/integration or other  
language use etc... in Eclipse.  Who else from industry would be a  
reasonable person to speak?

You can either just come and listen or you can do a quick 10 or 15  
minute presentation on what you've been playing with or thinking  
about; longer if you want.

We have 3 international folks coming so far even. :)

Hi All.
I've started playing around with Antlr, and was wondering if you can
point me to where I can find documentation on the following:
*) An example of a rule to match a regular expression where the number
of occurrences is fixed , and not zero-or-more or one-or-more (say like
[0|1]{4} in PERL)
*) An example of a rule to match a regular expression where the number
of occurrences is a variable that we've parsed from the input stream
(like [0|1]{$length} in PERL.

Hi

There is no such constructs in BNF notation used bu ANTLR,
but you can check this restriction and even more complex ones
using semantic predicates.

rule : ( occurence )* ;

matches 'occurence' zero or more times.

rule
{ int count = 0; } // counter
:
( { count < MAX }? // check additional stop condition
  occcurence 
  { count++; }     // increase counter
)*
// after loop has ended, check that counter is in range
{ MIN <= count && count <= MAX }?
;

MIN and MAX are user-defined variables or constants.
So, both your cases are covered.

{ count < MAX }? is semantic predicate checked 
before each 'occurence' match. If it is false, loop will stop.
Instead of 'count < MAX' there can be any expression.

{ MIN <= count && count <= MAX }? is semantic predicate checked after loop.
If it is false, SemanticException will be thrown.
So, it is other usage of semantic predicate.
Of course, 'MIN <= count && count <= MAX' can be any expression.

Best regards,
Alexey

Hello,
 
I think I should do it in the TreeParser but I don't know how. I try 
to explain it in this way:
 
-----------------------------------------------------------
class MyLexer extends Lexer;
A: 'a';
B: 'b';
C: 'c';
D: 'd';
----------------------------------------------------------
class MyParser extends Parser;
options{buildAST = true;}
start: A^ end ;
end: B | C ;
-------------------------------------------------------
class MyTreeWalker extends TreeParser;
options{buildAST = true;}
start: #(A (B | C));
----------------------------------------------------
 
So my program accept expresion 'ab' or 'ac'.
Now I need in TreeParser to add a token D after every token A (so when an input of TreeParser is 'ab' I want an output 'adb' and when an input is 'ac' I want an output 'adc').
 
And the 2nd case (a little different Parser and TreeParser) - how to remove in TreeParser a token (e.g. when as an input I have 'adc' I want to have as an output 'ac' etc.).
 
Maybe it's very simple but I couldn't find a method to add or remove node while I traverse in TreeParser a tree built in Parser. 
And when I tried to write it by myself it didn't work.

Thank you for every advise.
 
Regards,
Vaphel

Message-ID: <41fed8f805082104164cef576b@mail.gmail.com>

Ok here is my suggestion for a program to migrate existing docs to wiki.
Some suggestions have to been to write a full blown html parser that
will convert everything to confluence syntax.
That will take some effort.

How about this simpler solution-

We code one program where we can add filters.
The filters take in a string and do some modifications to it.

So then we have one filter to convert <h2>Title</h2> to h2.
Another for converting <pre></pre> to {code}{code}

This way no one person needs to write one huge program and nobody
needs to learn all of confluence syntax.
The program can be contributed to and extended by anybody. As we get
to know the syntax better, we can make better filters.
Also this can serve as two way. the same filter can be used to reverse
the string to html.eg-
h2. Title  to-
<h2>Title</h2>

So what do u think?

Good idea.
Maybe it would make sense to make it as a Confluence plug-in/extension 
(Confluence has an OpenAPI, as well as JIRA).
AFAIK this OpenAPI is the base for for a general plug-in API called 
"Tonic", independent of Confluence:
http://wiki.opensymphony.com/display/TON
https://tonic.dev.java.net/
IMHO it would make sense to write the 'migration tool' as an extension, 
since it will compatible with more wikis, and it will be easier to use 
it one can call the function directly from the wiki.

There are already many extensions for Confluence:
http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFEXT/

There's even a Word 2 wiki converter there:
http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CONFEXT/Word+to+Confluence+Converter

Perhaps I'm mistaken, but I think most of the existing stuff is
rendered from "TML", so we already have something that renders it in
html.

Rather than letting this grow and grow as we add requirements, I think
if we looked at the existing technologies, it's a solve problems.

In any case, I'd be surprised if some of the stringtemplate stuff
isn't applied in the web pages, and therefore retargeting is simply
new templates, rather than a rewrite.

The actual doc is written in raw (crappy) html.  But truly it's not  
that hard to translate...i used emacs with "query-replace-rexpr" and  
got pretty far, but I'm swamped with school starting...

I've already tweaked my TML HTML generator to use CSS.  For example,  
new course notes look much better; only added link to CSS def:

True.  Regex are a problem that way.  Could we do:

cat doc.html | tr -d '\n' | sed 's/<tt>\(.*\)</tt>/{{\1}}/g' >  
newdoc.html

or something?

  Hello together,

(please, sorry for my English)

I'm absolute newbie in ANTLR and have some question about usability of ANTLR for the following task(s).

I've some really big library written in C++ and like to port it to C#.
I'm sure, this can't be made automatically, but I want to automate same
tasks.

1. bring together .h and .cpp files and generate appropriate C# classes. Example
C++:

class D1: public B1
{
  private:
   void f1();
   void f2();
  public:
   void f3();
   void f4();
}

should became (in C#)

namespace LibName
{
public class D1: B1
{
  private void f1(){/*source from Cpp*/}
  private void f2(){/*source from Cpp*/}
  public void f3(){/*source from Cpp*/}
  public void f4(){/*source from Cpp*/}
}
...
}

2. If some function uses references or pointers it should be converted to references an annotated as
comment about its original: Example

void f1(const T1& t1, T2* t2)
can became (in C#) something like
void f1(T1 t1, T2 t2)
// t1: const ref T1
// t2: ptr T2

3. Convert some common <math> functions calls to C# Math function calls. I.e.:
abs(x) ==> Math.Abs(x)
fabs(x) ==>Math.Abs(x) /*because of overloading*/
...
cos(x) ==> Math.Cos(x)

4. Convert (very important) presented Doxygen Comments to (C#) XML-Comments. I.e.
@param ros some comment text
to
<param name="ros">some comment text</param>

5. Formal conversion of properties definition. I.e.

  __published:
     __property TDensity       Density={write=SetDensity, read=GetDensity};
   
should became:
 
     public TDensity Density
     {
         get { return SetDensity(); }
         set { SetDensity(value); } /*value is reserved word for value to set*/
    }

6. Removing of "const" (correctness) because it is not supported by C# at all.
7. Converting "->" to "."
8. Converting dynamic_cast<x>(y) to "y as x", etc.
9. Support for Borland extensions and event definition and maybe eliminate some of this. I.e.
__fastcall can be eliminated.
Replace "typedef declspec" by "event" , etc.

I would be very glad, if someone can provide some help for me.
Exceptionally for some related exaples.


Many thanks in advice for your help,

Alexander Landa

This is a BIG BIG task, and very difficult. ANTLR can help you parse the
source code, but you're going to have to write a very complicated
translator, which knows what type variables are (i.e. for overloading)
and all kinds of stuff like that.

Why don't you just use CLR's ability to execute compiled C++ code
directly? I'm not sure of Mono compiles C++, but the MS compiler
certainly does.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0508221336180.8003@cursor.mcs.suffolk.edu>

Hi,
   I'm trying to scan/parse the binary file, which has part header 
decription like this.

   Field        Type
   [N]bits      UB(5)
    A           SB(N)
    B           SB(N)

   since A and B have to be determined by the first 5 bits, I'm sort of 
stuck on how to define my lexer to have dynamic processing. is there any 
good solution or idea on dynamically parsing, something like Syntactic 
Predicates

http://www.antlr.org/doc/metalang.html#SyntacticPredicates

Thanks a lot~~

Message-ID: <20050823080848.59787.qmail@web60914.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

I'll be glad if you can help me about the following nondeterminism
problems:

OID: NUMERICOID | DESCR;
NUMERICOID: NUMBER (DOT NUMBER)+;
NUMBER: DIGIT | ( LDIGIT ( DIGIT )+ );
protected DOT: '.';
protected DIGIT: '0' | LDIGIT;
protected LDIGIT: '1'..'9';
protected DESCR: ALPHA ( ALPHA | DIGIT | '-' )*;
protected ALPHA: 'A'..'Z' | 'a'..'z';

and I have literal rules like in the lexer:
ID_AND: "and";
ID_OR: "or";

ANTLR complains about two nondeterminisms. The first one is for
NUMERICOID (and OID also) and NUMBER and the second one is for DESCR
(and OIS also) and ID_AND, ID_OR...

Thanks in advance.

Hi, the documentation for ANTLR 2.7.5 (Lexical Analysis with ANTLR)
[http://www.antlr.org/doc/lexer.html#Distinguishing_between_lexer_rules]
contains the following statement:

Are you implying that "keywords vs. identifiers" and "common prefixes"

Apologies - I forgot to add an example of the type of problem I'm
trying to solve.

I've got a file format that looks like the following:

Thing123 {
}

Thing124 {
}

System {
  // Set the default thing
  Thing = Thing123;
}

So, I'm trying to define a token rule to called THING_ID that is
distinct from a general identifier (like 'Thing').

Thanks,
Ciaran

So, you want to match any tokens of the following structure:

protected DIGIT : '0'..'9' ;

THING_ID: "Thing" ( DIGIT )+ ;

And where is the problem? Do you want to qualify Thing456 as ID instead of THING_ID
if Thing456 was not defined? You can check for it in code:

THING_ID
: "Thing" ( DIGIT )+ 
  { if( !isDefined( $getText ) ) $setType( ID ); }
;

For keywords and literals the documentation is good. For the common
prefixes I always thought the explanation was horrible. You can't
distinguish common prefixes of arbitrary length by increasing the
lookahead. You can however deal with them without syntactic predicates,
which the documentation doesn't mention.

What I like to do instead is a bit of DFA-style rules. For example,
instead of having:

INTEGER: ('0'..'9')+ ;
REAL: ('0'..'9')+ '.' ('0'..'9')+;

Which will cause you endless non-determinism pain and suffering, you can
do this:

INTEGER:
	('0'..'9')+
	( '.' ('0'..'9')+ { $setType(REAL); } )?
	;

Hope this helps,
-Olivier

Please note: when you 'Reply' to message from antlr list
it is sent to author, not in list. Use 'Reply all' and remove author :)

val:VALUE works only for tokens not for rules.
You have to return value from 'value' rule and use it such way: val = value

value returns [String res]
 : t:THING_ID { res = t.getText(); }
 | i:ID       { res = i.getText(); }
 ;

assignment
{
    String val = null;
}
 : id:ID ASSIGN val = value
  { System.out.println("Assigned: '" + id.getText() + "' val = '" + val + "'" ); }
 ;

'value' rule also can be implemented as:

value returns [String res]
{
    Token t = null;
}
 : 
  { t = LT(1); res = t.getText(); }
  (   THING_ID
    | ID
  )
 ;

LT(1) is the next token.
It is useful for long alternatives.

Alexey

For NUMBER, need to left factor the LDIGIT in both alternatives, try:

NUMBER : '0' | ( LDIGIT ( DIGIT )* ) ;

For DESCR, please read the Antlr documention about the tokens {...}
section in a lexer, the testLiterals=true option, and generally how to
deal with Keywords that look like Identifiers (don't remember the
specific chapter(s) in the docs, sorry).

Yes I've read them here:

But does not work for me. Any suggestions please?

something like (haven't actually run it through the tool):

class ErsinErLexer extends Lexer;

options { testLiterals=false; }

tokens { ID_AND="and"; ID_OR="or"; }

OID options{ testLiterals=true; } : NUMERICOID | DESCR;
protected DESCR: ALPHA ( ALPHA | DIGIT | '-' )*;
protected ALPHA: 'A'..'Z' | 'a'..'z';

NUMERICOID : ...whatever...

...other lexer rules, but *not* ID_AND | ID_OR...

Do you have the actual jar on the classpath, or the directory containing the
jar?
 
The easiest way to get it working is
 
  java -cp lib/antlr.jar foo.g
 
or whereever you have put antlr.
 
Hope this helps!

 Dear Mr. Christopher Schultz,
 
 many thanks for your answer.

 Maybe I'm completely wrong, but I think about ANTLR as a tool
 to generate translators from a grammars. C++ grammar is also
 present on ANTLR page or "John's PCCTS-based C++ Parser Page".
 So maybe it is only necessary to define some lexical rules with actions,
 that means only expand a given grammar or generated classes with
 user-defined actions. I don't know.

 In one newsgroup message I can read :
 "However, I have built a C++ scarfer for somebody that was 
 able to pick out class members and func defs relatively easily.  There's 
 no short cut for full C++ unfortunately.  Soon the World will fall back on another 
 language (with a sigh) or to a subset (with a snicker). " wroten by Terence J. Parr.
 But no future references to this 
 Maybe You know what this means? This can be very helpfully.

 No, not really, It is possible to generate "unchecked" (old common) C++ library
 an call functions to that library. But this have for my purposes to much disadvantages.
 1. It is only "ok" to call relative simple functions with simple data
 2. for complex types we must do complex marshaling (which very slow!)
 3. for complex types we must carefully define appropriate types in C# and maybe define proxy-functions in C++ library
 4. for point 3 we must also write a INTEROP "calling" Interface (this is like my first question) for each exported C++ function.
 At this point it can be very complicated to do this marshaling at all, if we use something like std::list<T> (it is much likely generic List<T>) in C# and can be very time and memory expensive.
 5. we have all the disadvantages of C# combined with disadvantages of C++ (i.e. insecure pointers)
 6. no callback possibilities (events, actions) from C++ to C# or I don't know how to do it, but in this case it is necessary to rewrite C++
 library at all
 7. no reasonable debugging possibilities
 8. and of course I wish continue developing of the library later without having of C# and C++ mixing.
 
 I think, it is at a starting point a very big task, but can save a lot of time later.
 
 
 Best regards,
 Alexander Landa

First of all, thank you very much for ANTLR and the support.

I've been reading messages about creating a custom *AST class to get the line 
number. Unfortunately I haven't been able to get it to keep/return the 
updated values. If there are any samples or pointers that show how to do this in C# 
mode (version 2.7.5) I'd be very grateful.

Thanks again.

 yeah, thanks Benjamin. After i did "caseSensitiveLiterals=false" in my

without case sensitivity.

Do you refer to literals - double quoted strings in parser rules? To make
these case insensitive, you have to set the option
caseSensitiveLiterals=false for the lexer (As Micheal said, only the lexer
handles the 'raw' text. Literals in parser rules are automagically copied
into the lexer's literal table).

  ok, thanks. then, how do i deal with filtering?

  Specifically, in my work, I have to distinguish between variable names and
statement names that look like each other.

  For example, i should make the distinguishment between "for" statement and
any variable starting with "for" like "foreign".

  For that reason, in my lexer, I get "for" followed by space(WS) or LPAREN
with the lexer, then pass it to the parser. Then, in my parser, I have to
skip that especially LPAREN, a kind of filtering. Is this kind of filtering
possible? If yes, How can i do this filtering?

 Serafettin

Parsers deal with TokenStreams (not CharacterStreams). Tokens have no "case"
as such since there are essentially just codes (int codes).

The lexemes attached to a token (e.g. the text of an IDENT token)would have
been dealt with - case-wise - in the lexer.

Cheers,

Micheal

  Hello,

  First, thanks for your instructions for sample tree parsers.

  I had a look at the "treewalk/treewalk.g" where the LCURLY is used as the
root of the AST. In the "imagNodeAST/treewalk.g" file it uses the imaginary
BLOCK token as the root. What is the difference between these taking
different kinds of roots, one is normal root with "^" and one is imaginary
token. Are they really different from each other?

In addition to the manual, there are fully working examples in an
examples directory if you download the full source tarball of antlr.
examples/java/treewalk/treewalk.g, transform and imagNodeAST might be
good starting points.

Have a look at 'testLiterals' in the manual - that's used in *exactly*
the situation you've described

Message-ID: <20050824104948.36257.qmail@web60919.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

I have problem with keyword in my language. Here is a simple production
(some action code ommited for briefness):

ss_base :
    "base" l_name=localName
    {
        // do something with l_name
    }
    ;

What ANTLR says about this grammar is:

"unexpected char 'b'"

The 'b' here is the 'b' of the "base". I face the same problem with all
my keywords. ANTLR allways complain about the first character of any
keyword in the parser productions. I did the testLiterals trick but it
did not help and in fact I do not have an identifier type)

Can you help please?

Greetings.

There are differences, but perhaps not in the way you are thinking of
them.  I usually use imaginary nodes to mark a tree for later
processing, or if I've figured out something important about that
node.

For example, an LCURLY can be either (1) a block statement or (2) a
set expression.  That means once I figure out which it is, I will
likely replace the LCURLY with BLOCK or SETEXPR,  To preserve source
file information, I typically just overwrite the type of the node
rather than replacing it:

   // overwrite node type:
   a_rule
   :
      ( LCURLY^ ... )
      { if (isStatement(##)) ##->setType(BLOCK) else ##->setType(SETEXPR); }
   ;

In later tree parsers, it is now easy to distinguish between BLOCK and
SETEXPR by the type of the node, rather than having to rediscover the
flavor of LCURLY...

Hope this helps

I have more information about the problem now:

If I do not have an identifier rule and if I have keywords in the

(and this is normal I think). If I have include the indentifier rule in

Now, is there any suggestions?

If you have no identifier rule in lexer, you should define all keywords in lexer rules:

BASE : "base" ;

Otherwise keywords should be in tokens section:

tokens
{
  BASE = "base";
}

And use tokens instead of strings in parser:

ss_base :
     BASE l_name=localName
     {
         // do something with l_name
     }
     ;

I beleive that strings in parser rules are processed correctly only when
they are belong to some lexer rule where literals are tested.

Alexey

Ok, now I have an identifier rule. Do I need a tokens block? As I said,
my program just hangs when i do the identifier block and testLiterals
stuff.

Thanks.

I think tokens block is not required in this case.
It is very hard to say why parser hangs without lexer/parser sources.

Thank you.

I'm sure it's something I'm doing but it's still returning the default values 
at the end. Changing initialize(Token tok) to initialize(IToken tok) made the 
compiler happy and _line = tok.getLine(); sets the correct line number, 
except it's not coming back on the other end.

Subject: [antlr-interest] syntactic predicates and semantic predicates
Message-ID: <dd3a065f05082407086fd5aabd@mail.gmail.com>

I've been doing some profiling (generating C++ code), and come to the
conclusion - no real surprise - that throwing exceptions are very
expensive.

How this works out in ANTLR is that I'm replacing syntactic predicates
with semantic predicates whereever possible:

   // the old code
   ( (LP) => bleah
   | ....


   // the new code
   ( { LA(1) == LP }? bleah
   | ...

This makes a big difference in processing time because it eliminates
the use of exceptions to evaluate the predicate.

Perhaps v3.0 can detect syntactic predicates that don't need exceptions?

Hope this helps others,
- Bryan

Subject: [antlr-interest] Keeping lookahead low
Message-ID: <cf63803e0508240846372c3dce@mail.gmail.com>

Following on from the help provided by Alexey and Olivier yesterday
I've cleaned up a test grammar I was working on and am left with one
question outstanding.

I have a test data file that looks like the following:
System {
  foo = Th       ! case 1:  BROKEN - rhs should be considered an ID
  foo = Thing    ! case 2: BROKEN - rhs should be considered an ID
  foo = Thing123 ! case 3: GOOD - rhs is a THING_ID
  foo = Thingy   ! case 4: GOOD - rhs is a regular id
  foo = foo      ! case 5: GOOD - rhs is a regular id
  Th = foo       ! case 6: BROKEN - lhs should be considered an ID
  Thing = foo    ! case 7: BROKEN - lhs should be considered an ID
  Thing123 = foo ! case 8: Why is error "expecting '}'" instead of expecting ID
  Thingy = foo   ! case 9: GOOD - lhs is a regular id
}

Can anyone tell me why the parser fails with the following error when
it endounters 'Th' or 'Thing'? Increasing lookahead to 6 fixes case 1
and case 2. Unfortunately increasing the lookahead isn't really an
option for me since, in reality, 'Thingy' is actually a 20 character
word.

What's the simplest thing I can do to the grammar to fix the cases
above that I've flagged as broken?

Oh, can anyone explain the error reported for case 8. This case is an
assignment that looks like:
THING_ID = ID

Since the grammar is expecting assignments of the form:
ID = ( ID | THING_ID)

I would have thought the parser would complain that it found a
THING_ID when it was expecting a regular ID. Instead it compains about
expecting '}'. Why is that?

Thanks a million (oh, grammar and test file attached)

Subject: [antlr-interest] tree transformation in Parser
Message-ID: <20050824164121.69121.qmail@web26504.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Hello,

maybe someone is able to help me - I become desperate.

My parser is able to parse a statement like this one:

  a = b = c = 4;

and it generates a tree that looks like:

<ROOT>  
|_ =
   |_ a
   |_ =
      |_ b
      |_ =
         |_ c
         |_ 4

after finishing the expression rules.

Does anybody have an idea how to transform this tree
so
that it looks like this one:

<ROOT>
|_ =
|  |_ a
|  |_ 4
|
|_ =
|   |_ b
|   |_ 4
|      
|_ =
   |_ c
   |_ 4

or 

<ROOT>
|_ =
|  |_ c
|  |_ 4
|
|_ =
|   |_ b
|   |_ c
|      
|_ =
   |_ a
   |_ b


In other terms I want to flat the multi-assignment.

Or does anybody have an idea how to flatten
multi-assignments in another way?

Please help!

Thanks 
Gregor Pardella

What does "except it's not coming back on the other end" mean?
 
What is the other end. Once you get your tree back from the parser, use the
ideas from the ASTFrame sample (or a debugger) to convince your self that
the AST really does have the line number.
 
For ASTFrame use, you might need to override ToString() to show line numbers
too.

That's a good observation.  I had a similar epiphany a few weeks ago, 
due to TokenStreamSelector::retry().  retry() is just a wrapper around a 
throw(), so if you switch streams a lot, you'll want to have something 
besides retry() to stitch them all together.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Compiling antlr's generated c++ code
Message-ID: <430CB482.1060107@gmail.com>

Hello,

I've used antlr for java-based projects before, and that seemed to work 
just fine. Now I want to use it for parsing stuff in a c++ based 
projects, and I am having problems linking the code.

I am using dev-c++ 4.9.9.2 with min-gw (gcc version 3.4.2). I compile 
with all include files from antlr 2.7.5 and with the libantlr.a in the 
library directory. I also include the -lantlr option. The result is that 
it compiles fine, but the linking stage goes totally wrong:

g++.exe src/color.o src/fonts.o src/gameframework.o src/graphics.o 
src/menu.o src/observer.o src/win.o src/widget.o src/GFWLexer.o

I cannot seem to understand why, perhaps any of you have had the same

Increasing lookahead to 6 fixes case 1 and case 2. Unfortunately
increasing the lookahead isn't really an option for me since, in
reality, 'Thingy' is actually a 20 character word.

What's the simplest thing I can do to the grammar to fix the cases
above that I've flagged as broken?

Oh, can anyone explain the error reported for case 8. This case is an
assignment that looks like:
THING_ID = ID

Since the grammar is expecting assignments of the form ID = ( ID |
THING_ID) I would have thought the parser would complain that it found
a THING_ID when it was expecting a regular ID. Instead it compains
about expecting '}'. Why is that?

Thanks a million (oh, grammar and test file attached)

Subject: [antlr-interest] Problem with semantic predicate in protected lexer
	rule
Message-ID: <200508241654.57249.dee@pestcontroldata.com>

I've no idea if this has been mentioned on the lists before but I've got a 
grammar which contains a protected lexer rule using a semantic predicate. The 
referencing rules properly match the input unless the semantic condition is 
unmet. In this case an exception is thrown instead of matching an alternative 
(non-predicated) rule. Interestingly enough, input which does not match any 
of the referring rules does match the alternative rule and everything is 
peachy. In case it's a code generation issue, the output language is C++.

The lexer grammar rules in question are (many others omitted for brevity):

COMMENT	:	DOTPREFIX! '.'	;

BREAK1	:	DOTPREFIX! 'b' ;

CENTER	:	DOTPREFIX! 'c' ;

PERIOD :		'.'  ;

protected
DOTPREFIX : {getColumn()==1}? '.' ;


With input of ".b", a BREAK1 is matched, input of "foo." matches PERIOD but 
"foo.bar" throws an exception "getColumn()=1". I can only presume it's 
attempting to match ".b" even though the semantic condition is false.

It seems to me that the DOTPREFIX predicate is not being hoisted high enough 
to prevent calling the rule when the condition is unmet. I've worked around 
the problem by eliminating the DOTPREFIX rule and adding the semantic 
predicate on all of the referencing rules but shouldn't a semantic predicate 
on a rule be considered by those rules which reference it? In other words, if 
"DOTPREFIX" is to be matched only when "getColumn()==1" then shouldn't BREAK1 
also require "getColumn()==1" to be true before it's matched?

In case anyone is curious, this bizarre grammar is used for processing text 
similar to nroff/troff. Works great unless the text includes a URL...

Thanks.

So, does anyone have a similar syntactic->semantic transform for tree
parsers?  I'm currently using
    { _t->getType() == BLEAH }? do_me_now
to replace the more expensive:
    ( BLEAH ) => do_me_now

What's really amusing is that in quite a few cases, the predicate I'm
adding is a duplicate of generated code...

PCCTS (ANTLR v1) was smart enough to know when the lookahead  
predicate was fixed and it used a non-exception mechanism. :)  Back  
to the future for v3? ;)

Why don't you change your ID rule check if the matched ID starts with Thing
(or whatever logic you have for THING_ID) and do $setType(THING_ID)

Message-ID: <20050824225408.44959.qmail@web60912.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,

We had implemented a mechanism with Piped Input/Output Stream to be
able to reuse parser and lexers without creating them each time.
However, we saw that this solution sometimes causes blocking.

Today we saw the implementation here:

http://www.antlr.org/pipermail/antlr-interest/2003-April/003631.html

We applied it and now it works..

What I want to ask is if there is a better way to do this now. Any
suggestion?

Greatings.

And I personally am waiting with bated breath for the next update to
this, which hopefully has syntactic predicates and lexer bug fixes
(especially the one where too many "strings" breaks the generated lexer.
Then maybe Ric would update his C template and I will be a happy bloke.
I would settle for a mini-update with lexer generation fixes though!

Yeah, I can fix those.  I have it on the list I believe...let me get  
a week or two into school so I can relax a bit...

I'm waiting on syntactic predicates to see the nature of non-LL(*)  
decisions.

No problem with 2.7.2 . We just did what we read, so it seems easy.
It'll be good if it's handled correctly with some abstraction methods
like parser.reset(), lexer.reset().

First off, apologies for the double post (it seems to take quite a
while for mails to be redistributed by the mailer)

> Why don't you change your ID rule check if the matched ID starts with Thing
> (or whatever logic you have for THING_ID) and do $setType(THING_ID)

Are you thinking of something along the following lines?
// Comment out old THING_ID
//THING_ID
//	:	"Thing"		
//		( INT
//		| CHAR (CHAR | DIGIT)* { $setType(ID); } )
//	;

ID
options {
	testLiterals = true;
}
	:	('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z') ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'0'..'9')*
		{
			String t = $getText;
			if( $getText.startsWith( "Thing" ) )
			{
				boolean isNumber = true;
				for( int i = 5; i < t.length(); i++ )
				{
					char c = t.charAt(i);
					if( c < '0' || '9' < c ) isNumber = false;
				}
				if( isNumber ) $setType( THING_ID );
			}
		}
	;

This definitely works (thank for the sample code Alexey). I'm going to
us it. Maybe it's just me but that approach doesn't feel elegant
though - just out of interest, is there another option?

Cheers,

Two days ago I've sent to you corrected grammar, but I don't see my changes in
grammar attached to your message. I've removed THING_ID rule
and changed ID rule as follows:

ID
options {
 testLiterals = true;
}
 : ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z') ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'0'..'9')*
  {
   String t = $getText;
   if( t.startsWith( "Thing" ) && t.length() > "Thing".length() )
   {
    boolean isNumber = true;
    for( int i = 5; i < t.length(); i++ )
    {
     char c = t.charAt(i);
     if( c < '0' || '9' < c ) isNumber = false;
    }
    if( isNumber ) $setType( THING_ID );
   }
  }
 ;

All your tests are GOOD.

When parser sees "THING_ID = ID" it decides that loop is finished
and tries to match token after loop. It is '}'.
I agree, message "expecting ID or '}'" is better, but ANTLR can't do that.

Alexey

Yeah - thanks for that Alexey. I finally figured out that my original

mutually exclusive!

You bet - thanks for that.

That's a shame.

Thanks for all your help.

Did you compile the support library with the same compiler?

I just read about that too, I've just installed the newest MinGW and 
MSYS to compile the libantlr.a file and compied that to my include 
folder. That didnt seem to do much though.

I am probably doing something wrong, as my c++ compiling skills aren't 
up to scratch.

Message-ID: <000001c5a9ae$5533a9e0$0200a8c0@i3l84zi9n7m5lm>

Members of the group who may need to improve the performance of any java
based transformers using ANTLR 2.7.5 would do well to look at gnu gcj. I
have managed to take a compiler.jar file and compile it down to an
executable to give a 60% increase in performance.

The compiler.jar file contains all the ANTLR class files and implementation
classes in one self contained unit.

 

This may not be good for everyone, but it enables us to keep the platform
independent java code, while customers who have platforms that support gcj,
can use the faster version.

 

Regards

C# already has built in support for reusing Lexer and Parser instances.
Perhaps it can be extended to the other codegen targets?

Subject: [antlr-interest] A bug about expression?
Message-ID: <20050828145932.18B8.OKAJIMA@poderosa.org>


 Hi,

 I found a suspicious behavior about antlr 2.7.5, and extracted a small
sample grammar to reproduce the behavior. The grammar file is attached.

 In the sample, there are two expressions e1 and e2. 

e1
	: e2 (COMMA e2)?
	;

e2
	: NUMBER
	| LP e1 RP
	;

 On the contrary, the generated source code for the expression e1
accepts "e2 RP" as input. This is the reason of the suspicious behavior I
found first.

public final void e1() throws RecognitionException, TokenStreamException {
  e2();
  switch ( LA(1)) {
  case COMMA:
    ...
  case RP:
  {
    break;
  }
  ....

 Does anybody have information about this behavior?

 regards,

Hi,

In fact, 'e1' rule doesn't accept 'e2 RP'. It consumes only e2
if it is not followed by COMMA. So, if you will use e1 as:

start : e1 EOF ;

there will be error message about RP instead of end-of-file.

Alexey

Subject: [antlr-interest] Incremental parsing?
Message-ID: <200508301901.j7UJ1BPA016722@a.mail.sonic.net>

Hi.  I have a shiny new language which is parsed by antlr, trying to
integrate with Visual Studio so I can have an IDE for said language.  When
VS loads a file, it first requests a full parse of the file.  Subsequent
edits to the file also generate parse requests, providing info on the
"dirty" source code region.

 

I'm currently taking the brute-force approach, which involves creating a new
lexer/parser and doing a full reparse on every parse request, regardless of
the specified dirty region.  That seems really inefficient.  Any suggestions
on better approaches?  Is there a way to do an incremental parse?  I'm
currently using the automatic AST generation facility.  Maybe incremental
parsing requires custom AST generation???

 

Any help greatly appreciated.

 

Dave

I'm currently working on incremental parsing with ANTLR Gramars.
It is not so trivial one might think (Lookaheads, State tracking and
matching). My approach will be a simple interpreted incremental parser,
and hopefully ready soon (prototype works actually).
Anyway, it will only update a simple parse tree in it's first version,
since automatic AST construction makes incremental parsing a lot more
complicated and no semantic predicates/scopes/actions are supported.

Sebastian.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Compiling Simple grammar with Visual C++ 6 using
	ANTLR 2.7.5
Message-ID: <A93344061C44D71199B60002B35EBA350245522B@mail.bal>

Hello,

I just wanted to mention first that the ANTLR library and the grammar
compile fine with ANTLR version 2.7.4.

When compiling the ANTLR 2.7.5 C++ library, I had to change a few things.
The main problem was the following lines:
1. std::min is not defined, had to change it to std::_MIN
2. Visual C++ 6 doesn't handle the static const initialization: 
            static const size_t MIN_TOKEN_INDEX = 0;
	static const char* DEFAULT_PROGRAM_NAME;
	static const int PROGRAM_INIT_SIZE = 100;
   I had a look in other files and there is a conditional compile for static
const that are replaced by enums. I did just that for the two ints but
couldn't for the constant char pointer. I redeclared the pointer char
pointer without const.
3. There were some methods returning void but were assigned a return value
and the compiler complained about that. I just removed the return
statements.
		void toStream( ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(std)ostream& out ) const
{
		  return toStream( out, MIN_TOKEN_INDEX,
getTokenStreamSize());
	            }
	changed to:
	           void toStream( ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(std)ostream& out )
const {
		   toStream( out, MIN_TOKEN_INDEX, getTokenStreamSize());
	            }

Once I got the library to compile, I tried compiling a simple grammar and I
got the following errors:

At compile time:

MyExprParser.cpp
MyExprParser.cpp(162) : error C2065: 'recover' : undeclared identifier
relates to the line:
	catch (ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)RecognitionException& ex) {
		reportError(ex);
		recover(ex,_tokenSet_5);
	}

I just create an empty macro for that function but then I get some link time
errors:

Subject: [antlr-interest] Antlr embedded in c++ dll... Token Type Export
Message-ID: <430C3459.5060505@digitech.fr>

Hi,
I am using Antlr in C++ dll.
I would like to export de ParserType generated like this.

#ifdef __cplusplus
struct CUSTOM_API DigiladParserTokenTypes {
#endif
    enum {
        EOF_ = 1,
        ABS_OP = 4,
        ENT_OP = 5,
    ...
        }
    };
#ifdef __cplusplus
};

My question is how (and where) I define the symbol CUSTOM_API to make 
the enum visible out of my librairy.

Or may I do this in a different way.

Thanks for your (coming) answers,

Message-ID: <430D8A83.9010000@berkeley.edu>

Hi all,

I am having some trouble with a seemingly simple rule.

protected
LINE_TERMINATOR
    : (
    /*
      Not sure why this is giving non-determinism errors.
      Attempt silence it (behavior is correct) (?)
    */
    options {
      warnWhenFollowAmbig=false; 
    } : (
      (
        '\n'
      | '\r'
      | '\u2028'
      | '\u2029'
      )+
    ) )
  ;

This rule attempts to match as many of these four characters as it can. 
ANTLR is giving strange non-determinism errors about it. Does it seem 
fundamentally flawed to anyone? Also, I have observed that the option 
set does not always silence non-determinism warnings.

The file options are:

options {
  testLiterals=false;
  k=5;
  caseSensitive=false;
  caseSensitiveLiterals=false;
  charVocabulary       = '\u0003'..'\uFFFE';
}


Best Regards,
Brien
