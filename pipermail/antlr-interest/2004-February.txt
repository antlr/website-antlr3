Subject: [antlr-interest] cgram: GnuCEmitter.g problem
Message-ID: <bvjmct+bk4e@eGroups.com>

I am having a problem with "GnuCEmitter.g" in "cgram". Here is a line
of C from "test26.c":

int foo asm ("myfoo") = 2;

When this line is processed by the following rule in "cgr":

attributeDecl:
        #( a:"__attribute"            { print( a ); }
           (b:. { print( b ); } )*
        )
        | #( n:NAsmAttribute            { print( n ); }
             lp:LPAREN                  { print( lp ); }
             expr                       { print( ")" ); }
             rp:RPAREN                  { print( rp ); }
           )
        ;

the result is:

int foo asm ( "myfoo" ) ) = 2 ;

because ")" is output at "expr" and at "rp". Have I made a mistake
somewhere or is there a bug in the grammar?

In-Reply-To: <bvgkdb+ttqq@eGroups.com>
Message-ID: <002f01c3e8ee$504dc3c0$01cf090a@penguin>

Hi there,

This is possible using only the lexer. I have a _very_ quick hack of the
Java lexer found at www.antlr.org which gives reasonable results. Some
sample outputs can be seen at
http://www.hi.is/~arnarbi/antlr-highlight/test.html and
http://www.hi.is/~arnarbi/antlr-highlight/test2.html

If anyone is interested, this hack is at
http://www.hi.is/~arnarbi/antlr-highlight/, the files you want are
highlight.g and highlight.java.

Message-ID: <200402012049.42095.saintiss@arklinux.org>

Hi,

I need to do some simple transformations on java source code.
Basically, what I'd like to do is turn declarations like this:
int myInt = 78;
into assignment statements like this:
myInt = 78;

so I took a look at the java grammar, which will be useful to parse the java 
source code. For the second part I thought it would be easiest to start with 
some code which just prints all nodes to System.out. I thought this would 
result in the input java source again, but instead I get something like the 
following:

CLASS_DEF
MODIFIERS
A
EXTENDS_CLAUSE
IMPLEMENTS_CLAUSE
OBJBLOCK
...
final
strictfp
H
EXTENDS_CLAUSE
IMPLEMENTS_CLAUSE
OBJBLOCK

The code I used was the following:

public static void printTree(AST t) {
        System.out.println(t.getText());
        if (t.getNumberOfChildren() != 0) { 
            AST child = t.getFirstChild();
            printTree(child);
            for (int i = 1; i < t.getNumberOfChildren(); i++) {
                child = child.getNextSibling();
                printTree(child);
            }       
        }       
    }


So it seems I got something wrong here... What do I have to do to just get the 
input back? Or isn't this the right approach for this kind of simple 
transformations?

Thanks in advance,

Hans Schippers

Hi,

Thanks for that article... It's certainly going in the right direction, except 
I can't get the engine to remember whitespace.
I did remove the rewriteEngine.discard(MyLexer.WS) call though...
I'm using the java.g grammar. Could the problem be that the lexer assigns the 
token "SKIP" to whitespace?

Thanks,

Hans

Ah.  Yeah, the WS cannot be SKIP or else the rewrite engine won't see

Hi,

Why is that? Was this something which was chosen deliberately, or rather 
something specific to antlr which could not be circumvented?

Hmm...

I get the impression that changing the token from SKIP to something else isn't 
that straightforward...
I added a token to the "tokens{}" section, and then changed 
setType(Token.SKIP) to setType(<new token>), but the parser doesn't seem to 
recognize java anymore...
Is there something I'm missing here?

Thanks,

Hans

Capitalism: 
You don't have any cows. The bank will not lend you money to buy cows, 
because you don't have any cows to put up as collateral.

Representative Democracy:
You have two cows. Your neighbors pick someone to tell you who gets the milk.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Not More Infinite Recursion
Message-ID: <20040202234850.27317.qmail@web12706.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,

First off, I lied; it is more infinite recursion.  

I've made quite a bit of progress with the converion
of my grammar from YACC to ANTLR.  There are still
pieces of the grammar though in which rules
'cyclically' reference other rules thereby generating
infinite recursions.  I'm having difficulty figuring
out how to rewrite these sections to eliminate the
left recursions.  Here is a slightly pared down
example:

//BEGIN EXAMPLE
dimentia:
	membrane B A
      |
	A C membrane D
      |
	gentle B A
      |
	A C gentle D
	;

gentle:
	G	
      |
	dimentia B E C
      |
	membrane B F C
      |
	F C dimentia H
      |
	F C membrane H
      |
	membrane B E C
      |
	E C dimentia H
      |
	E C membrane H
	;	

membrane:
	I
      |
	J
      |
	gentle B K 
      |
    membrane L K
	;
//END EXAMPLE

I've tried refactoring this every which way but I
can't seem to arrive at a solution.  For what it's
worth BISON consumes it without issuing any
shift/reduce warnings.  I'm not looking so much for a
solution to this particular grammar (though I wouldn't
complain if someone provided one) as I am looking for
a general strategy to solve this kind of problem.  I
apologize for rambling.  Any pointers anyone could
provide would be greatly apprciated.

Hi.  You need to remove the SKIP part, but tell the rewrite engine to 
discard (it actually just prevents the parser from seeing it).

Just delete the setType(Token.SKIP)--the "SKIP" says "ignore this token".

I'm very new to ANTRL myself (new, as in, a week), and I don't expect to
be writing my first grammar until later this week.  Prior to this, I've
written only ad hoc parsers, usually of fairly simple languages.

I've been looking at Jason's example for a while, and I'm not seeing
infinite recursion (recursion, but not infinite), but I think that's
because I'm always considering the right end.  Is Jason's grammar
problem one where LR(k) will work and LL(k) won't?

Thanks,
   Chris.

Subject: [antlr-interest] cgram: typedef name vs function name questions
Message-ID: <bvn4ce+oivc@eGroups.com>

I am interested in parsing C code is a consistent manner but the
output does not need to be suitable for a compiler. How can I cheat my
way around the following difficulty?

The following one line C file causes an error message in cgram (and
also gcc):

    xxx obj;

Correct parsing sometimes depends on knowing whether "xxx" is a
typedef name or a function name. Harbison & Steele say

    ... consider the program line

         A ( *B ) ;

    If "A" has been defined as a typedef name, then the line is a
    declaration of a variable "B" of type "pointer to A". (The
    parentheses surrounding "*B" are ignored.) If "A" is not a
    type name, then the line is a call of the function "A" with the
    single parameter "*B". This ambiguity cannot be resolved
grammatically.

This determination is somehow carried out in the "initDecl" rule in
"GnuCParser.g". How is this done? Is "xxx obj;" unambiguous because
there are no parentheses? If "B" has already been declared or there in
no "*", must "A" be a function name? I would like the grammar to
assume "xxx" is a typedef name unless it can deduce otherwise. How can
this be done?

Hi,

Ah, of course... sounds logical actually :-)

Thanks...

One more thing though: I don't really need the tree parser anymore now, so I 
thought I'd disable "buildAST" in java.g. However, antlr complains it doesn't 
know AST-specific variables such as #p, which are used inside actions. Is 
there a way to turn off AST building without having to remove all related 
actions?
Or is there no overhead at all if the getAST() method isn't called?

Thanks,

Hans

Well, the first question is why are you cheating around this?  Because
you're not parsing header files or something?

There is a method boolean isTypedefName(String name) which you could tweak
to act the way you want.  

I think that parenthesis are used for grouping, so you can't assume that A
(B) is a function call, but I'd have to dig into the spec to really know.

Subject: [antlr-interest] cgram: typedef name vs function name questions

I am interested in parsing C code is a consistent manner but the
output does not need to be suitable for a compiler. How can I cheat my
way around the following difficulty?

The following one line C file causes an error message in cgram (and
also gcc):

    xxx obj;

Correct parsing sometimes depends on knowing whether "xxx" is a
typedef name or a function name. Harbison & Steele say

    ... consider the program line

         A ( *B ) ;

    If "A" has been defined as a typedef name, then the line is a
    declaration of a variable "B" of type "pointer to A". (The
    parentheses surrounding "*B" are ignored.) If "A" is not a
    type name, then the line is a call of the function "A" with the
    single parameter "*B". This ambiguity cannot be resolved
grammatically.

This determination is somehow carried out in the "initDecl" rule in
"GnuCParser.g". How is this done? Is "xxx obj;" unambiguous because
there are no parentheses? If "B" has already been declared or there in
no "*", must "A" be a function name? I would like the grammar to
assume "xxx" is a typedef name unless it can deduce otherwise. How can
this be done?

Hmm...i'm not sure what would happen.  YOu might wanna remove the 
actions.  Not that expensive if it doesn't crash ;)

Hi,

when parsing a file containing nothing but the following line:

m = (TEST) d;

I get the following exception:

parser exception: emp.java:1:1: unexpected token: m
emp.java:1:1: unexpected token: m
        at JavaRecognizer.statement(JavaRecognizer.java:2058)
        at Main.parseFile(Main.java:81)
        at Main.doFile(Main.java:54)
        at Main.main(Main.java:24)

I'm calling the "statement()" method from the JavaRecognizer, so the file 
should be valid.
What's more, if I add a word (e.g. "smdfjmkj") on a line after the statement 
in the file, the parser does *not* throw the exception...

Is there an explanation for this?

Thanks,

Hans

You can't call arbitrary methods like statement or expr, you have to be sure
you have a rule with EOF that you call.  Like

statementComplete: statement EOF;

Hi,

when parsing a file containing nothing but the following line:

m = (TEST) d;

I get the following exception:

parser exception: emp.java:1:1: unexpected token: m
emp.java:1:1: unexpected token: m
        at JavaRecognizer.statement(JavaRecognizer.java:2058)
        at Main.parseFile(Main.java:81)
        at Main.doFile(Main.java:54)
        at Main.main(Main.java:24)

I'm calling the "statement()" method from the JavaRecognizer, so the file 
should be valid.
What's more, if I add a word (e.g. "smdfjmkj") on a line after the statement

in the file, the parser does *not* throw the exception...

Is there an explanation for this?

Thanks,

Hans

Howdy.

Yes, statement is not a "start symbol" EOF cannot follow it normally.  
YOu must make a rule liek this:

stat_entry : stat ;

not called by anybody so ANTLR does the right thing.  Then invoke the 
grammar from stat_entry.

The second problem you have is that you told antlr to match a 
statement, not two.  It ignores what it doesn't care.  It did theone 
statement and returned :)

Message-ID: <Sea1-F12692XpAPzj2G000203fd@hotmail.com>

Hi,

Is it possible to get some information on why a certain syntactic predicate 
failed?

eg. If I have the following rule:

a:
   (b)=> b
  | c

and b does not match, is it possible to have the "reason" why b failed? This 
would be the error message generated by:

a:
  b

ideally.

Is this possible?

Thanks in advance!

Hi

Depends on what you mean by the reason...do you mean the token sequence 
that failed?  You can use my new RewriteEngine to track all tokens and 
have an index number for each.  Then, upon failure (override a method 
or somethign) record what the token index is.  You can also record the 
index of when you started guessing.  Then you can print out a failed 
sequence if you know for sure you got an error from it...

Have tried using antlr.Tool's -traceParser flag?  Is this for debugging or
error reporting?  You can also set your debugger in that method and watch to
see what exception gets thrown.

Here's something to think about.  Error reporting generally excludes any
information from a failed predicate.  Sometimes the predicate fails,
everything else fails, and you would want to report something about the
possibilities it was expecting, including for the predicate.

I told it to match one statement indeed, but the problem is that it does *not* 
seem to ignore everything else... With this input:
m = (TEST) n;
there is one statement, but the parser crashes.
With this input:
m = (TEST) n;
tessmklj
The parser successfully parses the first statement, and does not crash... So 
that does look quite odd, no?

I see what you mean, but that doesn't seem to solve the problem.. Still 
getting the exact same exception... 
To me, it would seem that matching the statement should work *before* getting 
to EOF (after all the statement is complete when the ';' is read), which 
would explain why adding EOF doesn't work here: there is a problem while 
parsing the statement itself (also, the exception mentions that "m" is 
unexpected).
Or could the problem lie with the lookahead? The parser trying to read the 
next 2 tokens but stumbling upon EOF?

I'm a bit lost here...

Thanks,

Hans

If you are using the statement rule directly to match this, you expect this behavior--there is a lookahead set for statement which is 
checked and the "tessmklj" satisfies the lookahead.

You really need a "statementComplete" rule such as Monty suggested _without the EOF_, but called by no rule within your grammar 
(EOF makes sense if you are sure to get an EOF as the next token, but not if you may have extraneous garbage).  

BTW, why are you doing single statement matches?  If you are doing interpretation of phrases, I have a string InputBuffer class which 
can be refilled.  That will be included with the 2.8 distribution--I need it to support testing--but that won't be until after 2.7.3 is officially 
released.  I can send you a copy if you would like.

Ah, it *does* seem to work now (forgot to ignore whitespace once more)... 
Thanks... Interesting enough, adding a statementComplete rule is the key, but 
it doesn't matter if you call statement() or statementComplete() afterwards 
so it seems!
Does that mean that the mere fact of there being a rule which calls statement 
and is itself never called suffices to not have the lookahead set?

In fact, what I want to do is parse some user code, which must be a number of 
statements, and transform the declaration statements into assignment 
statements. Should work fine with the TokenStreamRewriteEngine by Terence... 
So I think an InputBuffer which can be refilled is not of much use in this 
case... Unless I'm missing your point?

Subject: [antlr-interest] Bug in cgrammar
Message-ID: <bvqj8t+99u6@eGroups.com>

I thing I found a bug in cgrammar.
I use GnuCParser.g to lex and parse the input file and GnuCEmitter.g
to print it out.

If I have the following input:

typedef struct { 
	unsigned char var1 ; 
} name1 ;
typedef struct { 
	unsigned char var2 ; 
} name2 ;

I get the following output:
typedef struct 0 
	unsigned char var1 ; 
} name1 ;
typedef struct 1 
	unsigned char var2 ; 
} name2 ;

Increasing numbers will be printed instead of "{".

I think the bug is in GnuCGrammar.g (and also in StdCGrammar.g) in the
rule "structOrUnionSpecifier". This rule should be changed like this
(two statements were outcommented):

structOrUnionSpecifier
  { String scopeName; }
  : sou:structOrUnion!
    ( ( ID LCURLY )=> i:ID l:LCURLY
      {
       scopeName = #sou.getText() + " " + #i.getText();
//     #l.setText(scopeName);
       pushScope(scopeName);
      }
      ( structDeclarationList )?
      { popScope();}
      RCURLY
     |   l1:LCURLY
       {
        scopeName = getAScopeName();
//      #l1.setText(scopeName);
        pushScope(scopeName);
       }
       ( structDeclarationList )?
        { popScope(); }
       RCURLY
     | ID
     )
     { ## = #( #sou, ## );}
     ;

In GnuCEmitter.g the rule "structOrUnionBody" should be changed like
this (I changed: 'print("{");' to: 'print(lc1);'):

structOrUnionBody
 : ( (ID LCURLY) => i1:ID lc1:LCURLY
     { print( i1 ); print ( lc1 ); tabs++; }
   ( structDeclarationList )?
     rc1:RCURLY { tabs--; print( rc1 ); }
   | lc2:LCURLY { print( lc2 ); tabs++; }
     ( structDeclarationList )?
     rc2:RCURLY { tabs--; print( rc2 ); }
   | i2:ID { print( i2 ); }
   );

It seems that it works correct now but it would be better if someone
other could check the changes, too.

If it's for debugging purpose you can turn on tracing (-tracexxx options to
antlr) You may have to override a few of the trace methods in the generated
classes to make tracing visible during guessing mode. Don't recall of the
top of my head if this last step is necessary.

Subject: [antlr-interest] TokenStreamRewriteEngine: possible to use non-terminals instead of tokens?
Message-ID: <200402041552.16246.saintiss@arklinux.org>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

I got the TokenStreamRewriteEngine working so that it just gives back the 
original string of what was parsed... 

Using the java.g grammar, what I would like to do now is delete the type 
specifier from a declaration statement:
"int myInt = 7;" => "myInt = 7;"

This should only be done when the declaration is a statement, and not when it 
is a class field for example...
So it should only apply for the rule:
statement
    :    (declaration)=> declaration SEMI!

However, it seems that the rewriteEngine can only delete a range of tokens. 
SEMI is a token, but "declaration" is not so it seems (I guess its type is 
"void" since that's the return type of the declaration() method?). Still, I 
can't put the replace action where the type token is, because that's in the 
"identifier" rule, which would mean all identifiers would be deleted...

So is there a way I can "navigate" from "declaration" to the typeSpec and then 
to the identifier token in order to remove it?

Thanks in advance,

Hans

Good catch.  The idea was to record the scope name in the text of the LCURLY
node.  So the other way (the way I intended) to make it work would be to
leave the parser as is and just change the emitter:

structOrUnionBody
 : ( (ID LCURLY) => i1:ID lc1:LCURLY
     { print( i1 ); print ( "{" ); tabs++; }
   ( structDeclarationList )?
     rc1:RCURLY { tabs--; print( rc1 ); }
   | lc2:LCURLY { print( "{" ); tabs++; }
     ( structDeclarationList )?
     rc2:RCURLY { tabs--; print( rc2 ); }
   | i2:ID { print( i2 ); }
   );

You need context info to trickle into typeSpec so that it knows when to 
remove that token.  you can pass a parameter around or set a context 
instance variable (ick).  Or, go the other way: just set an index in 
typeSpec as to the index of the ID token.  Then later if you ever want 
to delete it, you know the index.

I think I get the idea of what you're saying here... Setting an index in 
typeSpec intuitively seems the most elegant way to go to me, but is there 
documentation available on how to accomplish this? I mean, I guess it's 
needed to add an attribute to typeSpec's class definition, which is probably 
built-in to antlr?

Thanks,

Hans

There is no typeSpec.  Remember that antlr generates a method for each 
rule not a class, which is really icky...

just define an instance variable and set it with an action.

What happens is that the lookahead set for statement() now includes the lookahead set for statementComplete, so the answer is 
"yes".

No--I was just curious as to why you would be matching single statements.

Hrmm, I'm wondering if that's a safe way to go about?
Suppose you've got the following statement:

MyType myVar = new MyInterface {
		public myMethod() {
			int c = 5;
		}
	};

And suppose I'd like to get rid of "MyType", but not "int".
Working with one instance variable, it would probably work in this case, as 
"MyType" will be parsed before "int". But suppose I'd like to get rid of the 
initializer instead... Then "5" will be parsed before "new MyInterface....", 
so "5" will be deleted instead of "new MyInterface....", right?
If this is all true, then I guess a more intelligent mechanism will be needed, 
agree?

Yeah, instance variables are not so good, but much easier that passing 
something back a million times.  The new attribute mechanism for ANTLR 
will solve this.  To simulate, just created a stack for for every 
attribute you want.  Every time you enter a rule where you want to 
define an attribute, push a new value and then pop at end of rule.  
Here you'd do

IntAttributeStack typeIndexAttr = ... ;

Then in the rule you want to delete the type, do this:

{
typeIndexAttr.push(null);
}

then

{
typeIndexAttr.pop();
}

at the end.

In the typeSpec rule then, you'll set the top of stack to be a value.  
Back in the defining rule, you can peek at the top of stack and ask for 
the index. :)

This ensures that nested constructs work properly.

I must be misunderstanding this, because as far as I can see, this won't work 
in general...
Having a stack will work if there's a rule which calls itself directly or 
indirectly.
But rules called by this rule might also be calling themselves, which would 
reintroduce the problem that the top of stack is being overwritten.
Additionally (supposing I'm trying to delete an identifier), there may be 
subsequent identifiers, which are at the same nesting level, and so the top 
of stack will again be overwritten...
Trivial case:
myRule: identifier identifier otherRule;
Suppose I'm trying to get the index of the first identifier, that won't work, 
because the second will already have overwritten it... I know I could check 
the top of stack before the second identifier is parsed, but of course this 
is a trivial case, and in more complex cases it won't be so clear which parts 
of the rule will potentially overwrite the top of stack.

But I guess I'm missing something here?

Thanks,

Hans

identifier will set the attribute value and you are free to use it at 
the appropriate time.  In your myRule example, you need to make a copy 
of the index value before it calls identifier again.  This is 
simulating what a return value bubbling up would do.  It's set below, 
but each reference has a copy.  The instance variable approach avoids 
the problem of having to define the return value in all the 
intermediate rules and the stack avoids the "what about recursive rule 
ref" problem.

Hope this helps...

Indeed it will... The problem I was referring too, however, is that it is not 
always so obvious whether a rule is going to be recursive or not (because 
there might be many alternative sub-rules, and in a large grammar, it's 
probably tedious to check which of them eventually calls the original rule 
again). And as I see it, it is necessary to find all points of recursion, 
because each of those has a potential of overwriting the top of stack...

That will work as well, with the same problem as above: you need to be sure 
which sub-rules will eventually call "identifier", and make a copy for each 
of them. But it may be needed to make copies in sub-rules too, if they 
themselves call "identifier" multiple times, and so on...

So in conclusion, I guess it will work, but analyzing where pushes and pops 
and copies need to be made, is going to be almost as bad as having to pass a 
parameter...

Unless of course I'm overlooking something again, but I think I could make an 
example illustrating this if needed...

Message-ID: <20040205075049.36892.qmail@web60707.mail.yahoo.com>

Dear friends:
 
I just wanted to raise something that has regretfully come to play a major role in our usage of ANTLR. 
 
I work for a large corporation developing one of company's many software products. As part of the development, I needed a parser and for that I turned to ANTLR. After almost 6 months of hard work the parser was finished (thanks to ANTLR) and constituted the foundation for a number of core features for our product. We are now at a stage where we are ready to release the product, and as such and as is the case the corporate lawyers are going through every 3rd party component that has been used thus making sure there are no issues with licensing, etc.,, etc. etc.. And regretfully we have been told that we can not ship our product due to lack of proper licensing from ANTLR. In other words our product is on hold!
 
The issue is rather simple in terms of legalities but complex in the eyes of us as developers! Basically the issue is that ANTLR licensing does not explicitly state that those who have contributed (or will contribute)  to ANTLR can not claim anything financially or otherwise in any form or shape now or anytime in the future (i.e. standard open source licensing). The legal thinking is that anyone who has contributed to ANTLR can in effect claim monetary rewards from any company that uses the ANTLR parser (and its runtime library) in its product(s). Understandably comapnies (especially large corporations) can not (and in fact will not) be able to use the product for their own protections.
 
Hence because of not having a genuine "open source" licensing agreement, ANTLR remains (to us) as nothing but an academic experiemental project at best (despite its absolute uniquness in offering the industry something pf sp much value that can impact so many businesses and lives for the better).
 
As a developer my argue has been to please either turn the licensing into a genuine "open source"  standard agreement (as done for example for Linux, or MySQL, etc.), OR productize it so it will be available comercially to anyone who wants to use it (given of course the proper commercial licensing).
 
As it stands and regretfully we have to throw out 6 months of hard work and start from fresh seeking other alternatives to using ANTLR.
 
Sincerely,
 
Addi Jamshidi

I just had a look at the license, and it places ANTLR in the public
domain.  Public domain means /you/ own the code as much as does anyone
else -- we own it collectively as a human race.  One cannot claim any
rights over things placed in the public domain.  That is the nature of
public domain -- all proprietary rights are revoked.

Perhaps your lawyers are concerned that not all contributors have stated
that their contributions are also placed in the public domain?  This
might be a legitimate concern, I don't know.  But barring someone
claiming their code made it into the product 'by accident', public
domain is about as good a deal as you can get.  And a very generous
action by the authors.

Later,
   Chris.

Yes, this is the exact that concern and the argument that our lawyers are using and in their eyes this is what makes ANTLR NOT a genuine open source product. And this is truly sad in the eyes of us developers.

Well, open source is no guarantee, either.  You still need the statement
from the author.  But that's neither here nor there.  Is the list of
contributors large?  (I don't know -- I'm new to ANTLR.)  If it isn't it
should be fairly easy to get a statement from everyone placing their
contributions in the public domain.  If such a list doesn't already
exist, it might be useful to make checkin of code contingent on a
statement to that effect.

Later,
   Chris.

Hi Serge,

One cannot assign or reliquish the rights of others.  If someone
(anyone) contributed code to ANTLR and did not intend for it to be
placed in the public domain, then it wasn't, regardless of what the core
development team intended.

Addi's lawyer has a reasonable concern, and what we need is a
clarification from those "in the know" about what steps were taken to
ensure that all contributions were also placed in the public domain by
their respective authors.


> If not , we have better to do than discussing about software rights , even
> if the investment returns is delayed .

Unfortunately, it's not that simple.  I'll be using ANTLR primarily for
open-source projects.  But I can't offer a license on code I do not own
or for which I do not hold the legal right to do so.  Which means I
lose the protection of that license (ie. that I cannot be sued for
damages) when I offer the code for use.

As an example, if a company using my open-source, ANTLR-based software
is sued by such a contributor (one who contributed to ANTLR without
placing the code in the public domain or by providing some other
sufficiently open-source license), that company can turn around and sue
me for those damages.

Maybe you feel differently, but for me, it's well worth my time to
verify this stuff now.  And if I can't get those assurances, then I'll
probably be following Addi's company's lead in not using ANTLR.  And I
doubt I'll be the only open-source developer to do so.  And that would
be a real shame.

Later,
   Chris.

Hi,

Ok, I'm not an expert, nor am I an antlr developer, so this might be a very 
naive remark, but what if antlr is just re-released under the GPL license? 
Wouldn't that solve the problem?

Just my 2 cents....

Kind Regards,

Hans

A legal suit is unlikely. Ter's role as project lead and original
author, and his insistence that everything is pretty much public domain,
is about as sure-fire a guarantee as you can get that you will not get
sued. The doctrine of estoppel pretty much guarantees that such suit
would get thrown out as frivolous.

Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that you won't get sued. You only
need to look at the shenanigans with the SCO Group over linux to see
that. A cursory look at the FACTS will tell you that their suit is
hopeless, guaranteed to fail, and based very firmly in fantasy.
Unfortunately, that didn't stop them filing it ...

Ter says he wants Antlr to be used as widely as possible, hence his
aversion to any restrictive licencing (I don't think Antlr is public
domain, because that causes a few problems with some contributors ...).
Sadly, I think he needs to ditch his aversion to licencing and sort out
some sort of formal BSD, along with a "contributors" list that documents
their agreement to his licencing terms. Acutally, isn't that planned for
v3?

And I think the OP needs to point his lawyers at the SCO lawsuit (look
at www.groklaw.net), and point out that there is no guarantee of freedom
from suit - for anything! Point them also at the MS/Timeline dispute -
users of MS SQL-Server are vulnerable to A VALID suit from Timeline just
because they are using MS-supplied technology (and MS is protected
because they got themselves a licence). Basically, the OP's lawyers are
baying for the moon and fooling themselves, and this needs to be pointed
out very firmly with a clue-by-four. All you can really say to them is
that PRECEDENT (very important in legal circles :-) says they are LESS
likely to get sued for using Antlr, than they are for using MS
SQL-Server. And they are being unreasonable in holding Open Source to
far higher standards than they hold COTS stuff.

One cannot assign or reliquish the rights of others.  If someone
(anyone) contributed code to ANTLR and did not intend for it to be
placed in the public domain, then it wasn't, regardless of what the core
development team intended.

Addi's lawyer has a reasonable concern, and what we need is a
clarification from those "in the know" about what steps were taken to
ensure that all contributions were also placed in the public domain by
their respective authors.

Unfortunately, it's not that simple.  I'll be using ANTLR primarily for
open-source projects.  But I can't offer a license on code I do not own
or for which I do not hold the legal right to do so.  Which means I
lose the protection of that license (ie. that I cannot be sued for
damages) when I offer the code for use.

As an example, if a company using my open-source, ANTLR-based software
is sued by such a contributor (one who contributed to ANTLR without
placing the code in the public domain or by providing some other
sufficiently open-source license), that company can turn around and sue
me for those damages.

Maybe you feel differently, but for me, it's well worth my time to
verify this stuff now.  And if I can't get those assurances, then I'll
probably be following Addi's company's lead in not using ANTLR.  And I
doubt I'll be the only open-source developer to do so.  And that would
be a real shame.

Later,
   Chris.

MAJOR PROBLEMO, I think you might find ...

It's intended that Antlr should be included in commercial products. The
GPL is a no-no here. Large chunks have been contributed by people other
than Ter, and they might be licenced on terms that he is happy with, but
he doesn't have the right to relicence it.

And lastly, Antlr is a code generator. In other words, large chunks of
the stuff it generates would suddenly go GPL. MAJOR headaches for
anybody already doing as Ter wishes, and including it in a commercial
product ...

So no. The GPL would be a disaster here ...

Hi,

Ok, I'm not an expert, nor am I an antlr developer, so this might be a
very 
naive remark, but what if antlr is just re-released under the GPL
license? 
Wouldn't that solve the problem?

Just my 2 cents....

Kind Regards,

Hans

It's not a problem of the license included with the distribution.
There is nothing wrong (from an open-source perspective) about placing
ANTLR in the public domain.  (And GPL would certainly NOT help Addi with
his problem -- quite the contrary.)

The question Addi's lawyers have raised is simply this: have all
contributors to ANTLR placed their contributions in the public domain,
also?

In the case of licensed software, this is typically handled by having
contributors assign copyright to the principle owner of the product, who
then offers the open-source license.  In the case of public domain, it's
a little harder, as there is no owner.  But all that is needed is a
statement by each author placing eir contributions in the public domain.
A file in the distribution containing these statements would probably be
sufficient.

Later,
   Chris.

Hi,

Bah another license discussion :/

Please people stop theorizing until Ter wakes up ;) Reread the previous
discussion on licenses in the archives and you'll know what is planned for
next releases.

That said. I guess that the major contributors to antlr can be counted on 2
hands. I guess that it is possible to get a hold of most of them as well.
So getting a contributor list and/or retargetting the lot to BSD/Artistic
(which was the plan for ANTLR 3 if I recall right) after talking with the
main contributors should probably be doable. GPL is not an issue anyway
since its going against Terence's intentions.

A question that remains is how much should someone contribute to be
considered 'able to sue'... Yeah I got them to fix that typo in the docs so
pay up!! Yeah right... Life is easier without lawyers.

Another thing: people contributing to antlr would have seen these nice
license banners at the top of the source/docs etc. I guess any sane person
submitting patches etc. would expect it to be placed under that license.
And if they did not like that license they would not have contributed the
patches anyway.

Aside note. Going on the domains some people have been sending mail from
I'd say that quite a lot of quite big companies are already using antlr ;)

I guess productizing will give only much more trouble than getting hold of
the main contributors and relicensing to BSD/Artistic.

On another note... In 6 months you can recode the support library under
another license, tweak the codegenerator for it if necessary or plug a new
codegenerator (which you will own) in antlr, ship the product without antlr
itself and your own support lib. The generated code should not be a problem
then.

To say the least any capable developer should be able to do that in 1
month. Safes you the expense of 5 months labour...

Cheers,

Ric

How much of this is licensing? And how much of this is lawyers being
clueless? I suspect mostly the latter :-(

One only has to look at all the confusion over the meanings of the words
*licence* and *contract* to know that there are idiots everywhere -
including in the legal profession. Not helped by commercial customers
insisting on calling their crap "End User *LICENSING* Agreement"s, when
they are not licenses at all, but contracts.

I don't think the problem here is licensing at all. I think it's
educating lawyers. I just hope they're willing to be educated ...

Message-ID: <20040205124351.35753.qmail@web10509.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I want to extend the grammar of ANTLR, what would be
the best way to do this? 

For example, I want to define a new EBNF-like operator
'@' (that can be used like the '?', '+' and '*'
operators). 
My initial idea was to create a parser based on the
ANTLR grammar and extend it with the '@' operator.
This parser would insert some semantic actions on
places where the '@' occurs in the grammar and outputs
a general ANTLR grammar which conforms to the standard
ANTLR grammar. My program would simply work like a
preprocessor then.

So basicly I'm looking for a clean ANTLR grammar which
I can extend with an '@' operator and where I can
define the other rules as: output unmodified.

A problem with that is that I can't find a 'clean'
ANTLR grammar, only the one shipped with ANTLR but
that one contains a lot of semantic actions.

I don't think grammar inheritance is an option here,
since I don't need all the parser creation
functionalities from the original grammar.

Regards,
Rob van der Leek

Look for the antlr meta grammar in the file sharing section.

Your preprocessor idea sounds good. Inheritance I never found really
usefull as it's implemented in antlr that is...

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hi,

In the java.g grammar, I'm trying to parse a list of statements, by repeatedly 
calling a rule statementComplete:

statementComplete:
	statement;

A statement, afaik, always ends with SEMI or "}". However, it seems that the 
parser sometimes reads beyond that, probably for lookahead reasons.
For example, when parsing the following:

Method method = (Method) m;
final int myInt = 5;

After calling statementComplete once, and then calling the rewriteEngine's 
toOriginalString() method, I get:

"Method method = (Method) m;
final"

so the newline and "final" have been read as well, even though they obviously 
aren't part of the first statement. Is there a way to get rid of this? 
Preferrably a way to make sure no tokens are read beyond the actual 
statement?

Thanks,

Hans

PS Terence: there are a couple of minor bugs in the TokenStreamRewriteEngine 
as well:
1) In a couple of places, "programName" should be passed on to the 
addToSortedRewriteList, but isn't... (e.g. in public void replace(String 
programName, Token from, Token to, String text))
2) A delete operation should be defined as replace with text "", not text 
null, because the latter will put the characters n-u-l-l in the string...

MismatchedTokenException is being initialized incorrectly with a null

Howdy.  My intention has always been to publish work without 
restrictions of any kind so that nobody has to talk to a lawyer to use 
my work.  That was 15 years ago.  Now, some people won't use my 
software BECAUSE it has no restriction!  Kinda cracks me up.  I'm being 
punished for my generosity.  There have been a HUGE number of incoming 
patches over 15 years and it's too late to get formal emails from all 
of them.  Some are surely retired persons and off email like Knuth ;)  
Programmers understand what public domain means and they don't expect 
any compensation for patches.

Anyway, I get email regularly from lawyers at IBM and other big places 
that are used to suing everyone (a pox on their families).  They then 
worry that they will be sued by everyone.  This is a fact I cannot 
change.  Lawyers don't get that software patents and all the related 
heinousness is anathema to the anarchistic cooperative programming 
community (just my opinion, btw).  Programmers love to help each other; 
look at jGuru and the ilk.  When was the last time a lawyer helped out 
another one for free?

ANTLR 3.0 will be BSD license, however, this won't prevent issues 
raised in this thread: that contributors will come after users of the 
software for compensation.  BSD says "do what you want, but don't sue 
me".  Does this cover contributors?  I doubt it; only the original 
author is covered.  Do we need to modify it to say "any contributions 
acquire automatically the BSD license?"  Probably not since some lawyer 
will simply argue that that is not legal or some crap.

Anyway, there is no good solution.  The more we tighten up BSD or some 
other license, the more it will become necessary to consult the devil 
to use the software!  I hate this issue. :(  I've been wondering how to 
build a formal contributors list for 3.0 and perhaps we can add wording 
explicitly transferring ownership to me so that I can say I don't own 
it.  Bizarre.  After these sorts of discussions, it makes me want to do 
every line of code myself for 3.0.

A final note: people, please check the "license" on software before you 
use it.  I had to carefully read licenses for using Lucene, Resin, 
etc... when building jGuru.  Do it *before*, not *after*.

Thanks for your time and thanks for using ANTLR even though we're all 
going to be sued :(

Regards,
Terence

Just to echo Ric--Ter is a rabid believer in the idea that ANTLR have no limits on use.  Anyone contributing to ANTLR has already 
dealt with that (no one has disagreed that I know of) as a condition for contributing to ANTLR.

ANTLR 2.8 (will be released soon after 2.7.3 is final) and 3.x will be under an Open Source license.  The primary reason is so that my 
tree rewrite support and tree grammar generation stuff can be included; JPL/Caltech has a very good open source policy, but will not 
release to the public domain.  The idea is "credit where credit is due" and "avoid exposure to lawsuits".

Not in my case, no... I'm parsing 1 string, which contains several statements. 
EOF would work if I could parse the statements separately, but to do that I'd 
need to know where each new statement begins, for which I'd need a parser in 
the first place... So that'd be a vicious circle...

Thanks,

Hans

One the one hand, Terence wants to give everything away, to get the greatest
overall benefit to "society," and doesn't really want to spend a lot of his
valuable time on the the legal side.  That makes sense.

On the other side, companies want to be able to use ANTLR in their products,
and don't want to risk legal exposure.  But I think that most companies who
think about it a little will figure out that using ANTLR could add some
significant risk.  Therefore, they may be inclined to reinvent the wheel,
rather than using ANTLR.  This is contrary to Terence's goals, I think.

I am a programmer.  When I have programming issues, I handle them myself.
When I have legal issues, I talk with (and pay) my lawyer.

I guess what I would suggest is that for one of the new releases of ANTLR,
either V2.8 or V3.0, that "we" (the ANTLR community) hire a lawyer to figure
out the best approach to licensing.

I am sure the outcome of talking with an attorney will be something along
the lines of "well, you can't avoid risk completely, but if you do these (n)
things, you can minimize the risk..."  This is consistent with Terence's
statement that you can't really solve the problem.  But my point is, that
you can, with a relatively small investment, evalute and minimize the risk.
I think we owe it to all the current and future users of ANTLR to do our
best to solve this here and now, rather than ignoring it or pretending it
doesn't exist.

So my question to the group is, do many others think this issue is
significant enough to do this, and if so, do you feel it is important enough
to put in "real money" to get professional help with the licensing
agreement?

Best regards,

- Tom

I am involved in a project hosted by the Apache Software Foundation. 
Every contributor and committer has to sign an agreement and fax it to 
them where he has to declare every thing contributed or checked into the 
CVS will be under the ASF license. In case of patches it is common 
practice to simply apply them as every file has a header with the 
complete license. Also contributions are only accepted when they - at 
the time of the contribution - have exactly this header.

This does not seem to be a solution to the 2.7.x problem, but might be a 
way to go for 3.x or 2.8.x.

>>From my understanding (and of course I maybe wrong), but I believe our corporate lawyers have offered putting in place a licensing agreement that is genuinely meant to be for Open Source (without charging anything from the ANTLR community). Not sure what the outcome of it has been or whether it has been accepted. But regardless, ANTLR does not need to hire lawyers, all they need to do is to ask one of the comapnie's that is using (or wanted to use) the ANTLR runtime library to provide them with the proper licensing agreement and advice (after all it would be in the company's own interest).
 
FYI: Regretfully as it stands and as of today we have been told that the decision NOT to use ANTLR is final since the current licensing agreement leaves the corporation with potential law suits and liabilities in the future, and therefore we have to re-architect our product using other alternatives.

First up, I'm not trying to make your life difficult.  Really.  I
/greatly/ appreciate being able to use good software that I didn't have
to write, and ANTLR is making things possible for me that I probably
wouldn't have even tried without it.  /Thank you/.

Maybe I'm being presumptuous trying to find a solution to this problem,
being new here and all, but, at the very least, I need to know my
risks....  Fortunately, I'm not a lawyer, and I am generally willing to
take people at their word.

You mentioned that there have been many contributors over the years.
It's probably safe to ignore the ones who contributed a small bug fix or
whatever.  Of the ones who contributed significant amounts of code
(classes, performance enhancements, features, etc.), how confident are
you that every one of them knew and agreed with what was to be done with
their contributions (ie. placed in the public domain)?

I doubt it will assuage the fears of IBM's lawyers, or anything, but if
the list of contributors is long, and some may not have consented, what
about broadcasting a message where it is likely to be seen by most
asking anyone who contributed code without intending it to be placed in
the public domain to speak up now or "forever hold their peace."

You can't do it retroactively, but you could certainly start doing it
today, for all future contributions.  Getting ownership is the best
thing, because then you have full control over what to do with the code.

:-)  Yeah, I know the feeling.  But the law isn't all bad, and it's
meant primarily as a shield, not a sword.  Public domain is great (and
/very/ generous, as I mentioned), but the BSD and Academic Free licenses
are pretty much as good as, and provide /you/ and your work with
protection, too.

Indeed.  Especially licenses for Windows software.  Some of the clauses
creeping into the ninth or tenth page of those are pretty invasive....

As another poster mentioned, it's not likely.  I would just really like
to quantify that risk before trying to decide if it is acceptable.


Thanks,
   Chris.

What if I affirm that no one with any significant contributions has 
asked to hold on to rights to their portions?  Certainly if you are 
using Java output, you are covered as major contributions are generally 
the C++ and C# code generators.

Thank you Terence for your note.
 
Regretfully the big corporations (or at least their lawyers) do not see the same things as us developers and programmers do. As programmers we love to help one another (that is in our nature and just like an innocent child we take and give things as were are given and as we are asked to give). However the real world regretfully finds this innocence as part of a big conspiracy to screw the big corporations. The very same corporations whose programmers and developers belong to the same innocent community! I guess some have a hard to believe that there are still people out there (such as yourself and all those who have contributed to the ANTLR community) who do things just so they can do a good deed and that there is nothing selfish for personal gains associated with it!
 
In any event, in our case we have used the C# version of ANTLR (not Java), and hence things are a bit more complicated when it comes to the licensing agreement (something which we did fail to convince our lawyers that "its cool and its ok to use ANTLR and distribute it freely")!
 
Warmest regards,

Howdy. My intention has always been to publish work without

punished for my generosity. There have been a HUGE number of incoming 
patches over 15 years and it's too late to get formal emails from all 
of them. Some are surely retired persons and off email like Knuth ;) 
Programmers understand what public domain means and they don't expect 
any compensation for patches.

Anyway, I get email regularly from lawyers at IBM and other big places 
that are used to suing everyone (a pox on their families). They then 
worry that they will be sued by everyone. This is a fact I cannot 
change. Lawyers don't get that software patents and all the related 
heinousness is anathema to the anarchistic cooperative programming 
community (just my opinion, btw). Programmers love to help each other; 
look at jGuru and the ilk. When was the last time a lawyer helped out 
another one for free?

ANTLR 3.0 will be BSD license, however, this won't prevent issues 
raised in this thread: that contributors will come after users of the 
software for compensation. BSD says "do what you want, but don't sue 
me". Does this cover contributors? I doubt it; only the original 
author is covered. Do we need to modify it to say "any contributions 
acquire automatically the BSD license?" Probably not since some lawyer 
will simply argue that that is not legal or some crap.

Anyway, there is no good solution. The more we tighten up BSD or some 
other license, the more it will become necessary to consult the devil 
to use the software! I hate this issue. :( I've been wondering how to 
build a formal contributors list for 3.0 and perhaps we can add wording 
explicitly transferring ownership to me so that I can say I don't own 
it. Bizarre. After these sorts of discussions, it makes me want to do 
every line of code myself for 3.0.

A final note: people, please check the "license" on software before you 
use it. I had to carefully read licenses for using Lucene, Resin, 
etc... when building jGuru. Do it *before*, not *after*.

Thanks for your time and thanks for using ANTLR even though we're all 
going to be sued :(

You did see my suggestion of adding a custom codegenerator to antlr and an
own support lib ? As long as you don't have to ship the antlr tool itself
this looks a valid option to me.

A manager would have to be seriously stupid not to consider that option
since retargetting a codegenerator for antlr is a lot less work than the 6
months work you guys spent in making your current parser. A small
calculation in costs will of course turn this in something even an
accountant can understand...

Ric

Ok , As far as I can see , we here can use ANTLR quite safely for our
internal needs ,
but we will have to move to other tools if we plan to distribute our
internal tools :
Are other people coming to the same conclusion ? I came to Ric suggestion
too .

Some quick comments:

1.)  ANTLR will be going Open Source soon, so in the long term there will be a solution.

2.)  For C# code generation--Addi's concern--there are a limited number of developers (and of people who contributed patches), the 
development is all recent (within 2 years), and one of the principal developers (Micheal Jor) is active in this group.  I doubt that it would 
take much time for Addi's lawyers to contact all contributors.

Hi!

I'm trying to compile antlr-2.7.3rc2 as a dll using MSVC 7.1. When trying

Linking with a statically linked antlr-lib works.
Can anyone help me getting rid of this error?

Hi,

I rushed to check out new rc version. But C# generated code does not 
compile at all. Here is the reason:

File CSharpCodeGenerator.java, line 2521 reads:

println("override public new Token nextToken()\t\t\t//throws 
TokenStreamException");

the above line generates uncompilable code - modifiers "new" 
and "override" are mutually exclusive.

For what its worth the gnu project have some info on this:
         http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain_4.html#SEC4

They make you sign a document assigning copyright to the fsf before you can 
submit a patch.  Or alternatively sign and fax a doc saying you are 
releasing the code into the public domain.

For my project i just asked anyone who sent me a patch to explicitly say 
in  email that they were licensing it to me under the project license.  Did 
not think it was right to ask other people to assign their copyright to me 
and to be honest could not be bothered with asking everyone to fax me a doc 
with a signature saying they were licensing the code under the project license.

I also had trouble in one case where somebody did a patch at work but 
didn't or couldn't get the permission of their employer.  I could not 
include the patch which was frustrating.

If i was in your position i would keep track of new contributors in a file 
somewhere and include their name & email in the comments when adding their 
code to source control.  First time they give you a patch maybe ask them 
explicitly "Is this code ok being put into the public domain?"

PS Does the lawyer who started this realise BEA have being shipping 
weblogic for years with antlr included?

Thanks for the report Tom. This was caught and fixed before the
release - uncompilable code has that effect ;-) - but it somehow
managed to slip into rc2 anyhows.

It will be corrected in the next release. As a workaround pls delete
"new" from that line in CSharpCodeGenerator.java.

Those are not implemented per default. You need to use a custom AST with
them defined:

http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=62654

Note that this does not catch all automatically generated AST's e.g. some
you still have to patch up manually.

Hi Jan,
  The process of getting line/column information is not trivial.  The
instructions on antlraux provide a good road map.

P.S.  I see Ric Klaren has provided an answer to your question... but
antlraux might provide further clarification.

Subject: [antlr-interest] How to conditionnally ignore tokens in Parser
Message-ID: <c0896l+qmqb@eGroups.com>

Hi,

I'm using ANTLR to update java files, replacing certain methods with regenerated ones. 
Currently, the operation cuts everything between the METHO_DEF and the next "field". This 
eats any comment in-between and doesn't behave nicely when the method is the last field 
of the class.

{Writing this, the solution came: keep the RCURLY to remember the proper position.}

I know the Lexer can SKIP or filter unwanted tokens, a stream could discard or hide them. 
But can the Parser ignore certain tokens most of the time and process them only in certain 
rules? Is there a way for a rule to pull out hidden tokens and process them?

Message-ID: <c089vq+bfei@eGroups.com>

Hi,

I downloaded ANTLR2.7.3 package with project version "2.7.3 (20040105-
74)". After modified the classpath, I ran "java antlr.Tool" in 
command window under windows 2000. I got a "Bad major version number" 
error. This never happened with 2.7.1 or 2.7.2. 

So, I tried to rebuild ANTLR with JDK1.1.8. The "javac *.java" passed 
smoothly. However, after I ran "Java antlr.build.Tool build" under 
the antlr-2.7.3 root directory, i got like tons of errors. 

Any suggestion/help I may have? Especially for the "Bad major version 
number" issue.

Thanks in advance!

Luc

It's probably due to me building my snapshots most of the time with jikes.
This probably means you'd need at least java 1.3 to run the class files per
default. I recently noticed some trouble with jikes compiled stuff and
older java versions.

You might try grabbing Terences release candidate 2 which is newer than
that snapshot you used (I assume he uses java 1.1 or 1.2 to build
releases):

http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-2.7.3rc2.tar.gz

I'm not 100% sure if JDK 1.1 is still supported... If you got 1.2 or better
around you could try building with that one. Without some error messages
samples I can't say much. It could be that there's still some old class
files around ?

BTW why run antlr.build if you already compiled everything ? Drop the old
jar file and put the root of the antlr distro in the classpath and you
should be ready to roll.

Cheers,

Ric

For both sun javac and jikes you can use the target flag to set this ie for 
1.1 compatibility
         javac -target 1.1 File.java
         jikes -target 1.1 File.java

To get antlr to build under 2.7.2 i always had to run through this procedure:

         cd antlr-2.7.2
         find antlr -name '*.class' -exec rm {} \;
         javac -classpath . antlr/build/*.java
         javac -classpath . antlr/J*.java
         java -classpath . antlr.build.Tool build
         java -classpath . antlr.build.Tool jar

There are also interesting bootstrapping problems you end up with a 
different result i think depending on what antlr.jar is sitting in the 
build directory when you start.

Hi Ric,

Thank you for your prompty reply. I used JDK 1.4.2 to run the ANTLR-
2.7.3rc2 and the problem is solved. 

There is one minor thing you may feel interested. I managed to build 
the Dll with MSVC7.1. Everything but the dll.cpp caused a couple of 
errors. After I deleted the #endif statement right above:

#ifdef ANTLR_CXX_SUPPORTS_NAMESPACE
}
#endif

// Add instantiations for MSVC 7.1 here if necessary..

#endif 


The building succeeded.

Anybody else met this, too?

regards,

Luc

I built the DLL file of ANTLR2.7.3rc2 with MSVC7.1. I then generated

If I don't use the dll file, and just simpley put everything 
including ANTLR files into the project and build them together, they 
worked fine. 

Any suggestion?

Thanks

btw, the release version of the dll file is 32kb, the debug version 
is 324kb.

Jorg,

Don't know if anyone answered your question. Make sure you have both

ANTLR_EXPORTS
ANTLR_CXX_SUPPORTS_NAMESPACE

In your preprocessor defines. For the application that is linking in the library make sure you have 

ANTLR_IMPORTS 

In the preprocessor defines. For MS specific solutions I normally make the import the default and place the export in the precompiled header but I assume Ric didn't do this due to the specifics of other compilers.

Hi Richard!

Thanks for your suggestions, but I had those already defined. It's also the 
only symbol which does not get resolved, all the other symbols are found. So 
it has to be a problem with this symbol not being exported by the dll (since 
the static build works...). Does anyone know how to fix this?

Hi Ric!

There is a bug in dll.cpp, you wrote an #endif instead of an #else. I've 
attached a unified diff, which fixes this. Please apply.

Could it be that it needs a implicit isntantiation ? I was told MSVC7.1
didn't need this but I'm not sure wether that was tested lately. If you
have a look at dll.cpp then you'll notice a whole load of implicit
instantiations of templates for msvc 7.0 try adding the one for ASTRefcount
to a MSVC7.1 specific section and see if that helps.

// these come from AST.hpp
template class ANTLR_API ASTRefCount< AST >;

If you get this to work then I'd appreciate patches so it will work for
antlr 2.7.3.

Of course the antlr lib isn't that big so you could also ask yourself
wether you really need a dll...

It by the way looks like that it's pretty easy to make a dll with MinGW on
win32. I did not get to testing that dll yet but building it was easy. I
hope to get a mingw/cygwin build out of the box for the next prerelease.

Cheers,

Ric

Ack that #endif there is a stray... I never was able to really test that
file. It probably got left in after moving some stuff around.

Now I'm curious why one person with MSVC7.1 did not run into this and got a
missing symbol when using the dll and you ran into this and got a working
dll ?

Subject: [antlr-interest] Code Generation
Message-ID: <c0a83t+4ctd@eGroups.com>

Hi there,

Iam a new user of ANTLR.I have planned to design a compiler and am 
using ANTLR for generating the parser and the scanner.Could some one 
tell me whether embedding code in the grammar file  (that emits 
Intermediate code of a virtual machine) is possible while writing 
semantic actions in the grammar file.

1.  i wanna know whether embedding all the semantic checking  as well 
as code generation in the grammar file is possible
2.if possible how can one do that?(Please provide some links to some 
example).I have studied many text books which suggests using LALR 
parser for code generation
3. Since it is a LL parser will i get struck in the middle of the 
development?
4.It is mentioned that if some rules have common left prefixes

  say for eg) PR : "return"
              PRV : "ret"
here i have to make three look aheads.If supposei have two rules that 
are similar in many characters, is it advisable to increase the 
lookahead size?Is there any other way out?

Please help me
Thanx in advance
Shomi

Could it be that there was an old .o file around that got picked up ?

You are using the same settings #define wise for the release and debug
build ? Debug versions can be a lot bigger due to symbols. 32Kb looks a bit
on the small side though.

You did build the dll while including dll.cpp and included the patch that
flew over the list just now ?

Cheers,

Ric

PS I don't have MSVC so I can only give generic help with respect to these
compilers.

Bootstrapping is a problem at times especially with a make clean thrown in
at times. Although you can set BOOTSTRAP_JAR before configuring to set a
antlr.jar for use when generating stuff after make clean.

The native gcj build has a very nasty bootstrap problem which I should
still fix. But that's not a high priority since quite a lot of native
executables still crash (without much reason).

Cheers,

Ric

If you mean just writing C++/C#/Java code as actions between the
lexer/grammar/treewalker rules then that's a yes. It will depend on your
grammar if you can do everything in one pass.

See the docs on antlr org. Download a distribution and have a look at the
examples directory. The files section on antlr.org might contain some
goodies as well. 

LALR has advantages at times LL works too, you only need to write things a
little different. Recursive descent parsers are a bit easier to debug due
to the readability of the generated code. Most free LALR parser have very
bad default error handling. ANTLR is a lot better with this respect
(although there are better ones) it generates pretty decent error messages
per default and if you put a bit time into it they can be greatly improved.

with ANTLR.

Left factoring will fix that. Most compiler design books got sections on
recursive descent and left factoring. For a lexer rule you'd rewrite to
something like:

PR_OR_PRV: "ret" { $setType(PRV); } ( "urn" { $setType(PR); } )? ;

There's a lot of info on left factoring in the faq's on antlr at
www.jguru.com (although much of the faq is very outdated :( ) In general
it's rare if you have to use a lookahead bigger than 2-3 if you need to
have a bigger lookahead you don't have to worry too much either since ANTLR
will always use the smallest lookahead necessary for a decision. It only
makes code generation times bigger. Most special cases that occur with a
small lookahead can be fixed with semantic and syntactic predicates (at a
performance cost depending on the grammar)

ANTLR has a somewhat steep learning curve in the beginning (I guess mostly
due to the manual it has all the info but it's organization is less than
ideal) Especially ANTLR lexers take some getting used to if you come from
the lex/flex camp. But once you get your mind around it ANTLR works very
well.

Cheers,

Ric

Hello sir,
 
Thanx for the reply.
 
The grammar that iam using is that of C++. 
What i meant was, instead of generating an AST and then walking the tree down to Emit the machine code(MSIL of dotNET, using the Reflection.Emit API) , can i straight away emit the instructions within the actions in the grammar file? 
 
Will it be  an effective approach?
If it were a LALR parser , I'll generate the code when i make a reduce actions .In LL parser should i have to separate a module for codegeneration ?
 
Please reply
Shomitha

www.jguru.com (although much of the faq is very outdated :( ) In general
it's rare if you have to use a lookahead bigger than 2-3 if you need to
have a bigger lookahead you don't have to worry too much either since ANTLR
will always use the smallest lookahead necessary for a decision. It only
makes code generation times bigger. Most special cases that occur with a
small lookahead can be fixed with semantic and syntactic predicates (at a
performance cost depending on the grammar)

ANTLR has a somewhat steep learning curve in the beginning (I guess mostly
due to the manual it has all the info but it's organization is less than
ideal) Especially ANTLR lexers take some getting used to if you come from
the lex/flex camp. But once you get your mind around it ANTLR works very
well.

Cheers,

My first impression would be that with C++ as input language there's no
chance to support the full language in one pass. Instantiation of templates
and probably some other things with operator overloading will require a lot
of non-trivial processing.

C++ is very nasty to parse. Terence & David can probably give you more
advice on parsing C++.

I doubt wether that will work in one pass with a LALR parser as well. Again
it depends on how much of the C++ language you need to generate code for.

(Or am I misunderstanding you and you want to use antlr in C++ mode for
your project e.g. have antlr generate C++ files you compile and then
generate for you specific problem (not C++ as input) code)

Cheers,

Ric

Yes, I included the dll.cpp(modified version), and built 
successfully. I couldn't make the static library out of rc2. If 
somebody knows how to make it, I'd appreciate if the method can be 
posted here.

I couldn't find the patch now. May I have either the link or an

Thanks.

You could emit code from your grammar directly, but usually you want more
information than just what you are parsing at the moment.  ANTLR's trees
really shine here.  A typical compiler parses into trees and then has
multiple passes over the trees to analyze and optimize the code.  The last
pass then generates the code for output.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Code Generation

Hi there,

Iam a new user of ANTLR.I have planned to design a compiler and am 
using ANTLR for generating the parser and the scanner.Could some one 
tell me whether embedding code in the grammar file  (that emits 
Intermediate code of a virtual machine) is possible while writing 
semantic actions in the grammar file.

1.  i wanna know whether embedding all the semantic checking  as well 
as code generation in the grammar file is possible
2.if possible how can one do that?(Please provide some links to some 
example).I have studied many text books which suggests using LALR 
parser for code generation
3. Since it is a LL parser will i get struck in the middle of the 
development?
4.It is mentioned that if some rules have common left prefixes

  say for eg) PR : "return"
              PRV : "ret"
here i have to make three look aheads.If supposei have two rules that 
are similar in many characters, is it advisable to increase the 
lookahead size?Is there any other way out?

Please help me
Thanx in advance
Shomi

FYI, the term for what you're talking about in terms of generating code
directly as you parse the file is called "syntax-directed translation".
[Personally, I consider it to be an "S.T.D." if used for any serious,
non-trivial languages. :-)]


Are you talking about a compiler *for* the C++ language or that you're
going to be writing the ANTLR actions for your compiler *using* C++ (or
both)?

The complete C++ language cannot be fully compiled to e.g., object code in
a strictly syntax directed manner (using any kind of automated translator
generators be they LALR, LL, etc.). [Of course, you may be "compiling" it
to some sort of smart, C++ "interpreter" but that would just be pushing off
all of the hard stuff to the interpreter.]

If you're compiling a language which can be fully compiled in a syntax
direct manner than certainly you can do that via ANTLR.


In terms of SDT vs. Trees, is there any reason besides "performance" that
you think you should do this project using SDT?

Thanks,
	John

Consider the following grammar:

If you build this and feed it 'foo "foo"', you get ( foo "foo" ), as 
you'd expect.  Now comes the tricky bit: add bangs to the STRING rule 
to exclude the enclosing quote marks, so now it reads '"'! ( ~('"') )* 
'"'! .  Try the input 'foo "foo"' again, and now you get a complaint 
about an unexpected token foo -- it thought the string was a keyword!

This is easy enough to work around -- just don't use the bangs, and

Your string rule is testing for literals.  Turn off the testLiterals option
for the lexer and then turn it on for the ID rule.

As Ric and John point out, C++ is a difficult language and even the industrial-grade compilers don't always do the right thing.  Even if 
you want to do direct code generation, you are better off starting out building ASTs and going through multiple tree transformation 
steps to handle preprocessing, templates, and the function versus object initialization ambiguity.  Once you have developed a good 
understanding of the translation problem, then you might be able to rework or eliminate some of the transformation steps--but I would 
not bet that that will be possible.  Your biggest problem is going to be to get the translation working correctly.  That is a big enough 
problem that you probably cannot afford to worry about performance until you have a working translator.

Message-ID: <BA38992C3BC5B543BEE63132C4B45AF76EFF9B@uscimplm001.net.plm.eds.com>


I have a language that I am preparing a grammer for. The language sometimes has dual uses for some of the tokens.

For instance, I sometimes have to match keywords like "integer" in the following phrase:
"define integer constant HostNameLength = 20;"

In this case, I match this phrase with the following:

protected
defineIntegerConstant
	:	"define" "integer" "constant" ID EQUAL  INT ((SEMI)=>SEMI)?
	;


But then I sometimes I have other phrases where I don't won't the "integer" keyword returned as the LITERAL_integer, but instead returned as a IDENTIFIER. For example in the following phrase, the word integer could be any type: integer, ObjectPtr, float, boolean, string, etc. In the example below, I need to match "update" COLON ID ID

"define object message EvaluateForFrozen (
	update: integer mfail);"

How do I get the lexer to return a INDENTIER instead of a LITERAL_integer?

Thanks, Bob

I'm not sure that it's the only problem, but the ANTLR grammar does not recognize '+' or '*' as suffixes--you need the parentheses.  
Replace WS* with (WS)* and CRLF with (CRLF)+.

Also, for most grammars it is better to ignore the formatting information--WS and CRLF (set token type to "SKIP"), for example.  
There are exceptions, but they are better identified as such.

Thanks for the fix, that sets it up just fine.

As it happens, it seems that there are spaces where a whitespace is
semantically different from one with a linefeed in it, so i'm kind of
stuck with it.

However, since i'm getting answers anyway, perhaps i can get a tip on
this one as well:

I want rules to match a few different types of words - there's a few
literals, some words that begin "X-" and then there's a few places
where any non-control ascii character is allowed, provided semicolons
are escaped.

These are three separate types of token, but you can imagine there are
a few ambiguities - how do i go about handling that?

Sorry--that doesn't give a clear picture.  Syntactic predicates are a
good way of brute-forcing your way past ambiguities--you can later go
back and refactor.  For keyword-rich specifications, it usually helps
to construct symbol tables, recognize generic tokens, and use semantic
predicates to look up values in the symbol tables to identify specific
use.

Read the FAQ.

Sounds like it's very difficult to avoid :-(

Trying to explain simply, when it tries to parse eg an if statement, you
can have "IF THEN" and "IF THEN ELSE". It can't tell the difference
between the two when it hits the THEN. It gets worse :-( because I'll be
trying to parse IF condition LOCKED THEN ELSE ON-ERROR where the syntax
says they're all optional provided there's at least one of them. OUCH!

Cheers,
Wol

Hello,
 
The grammar i have chosen is a sub-set of C++ language.I want to get the C++ language get compiled down to MSIL(Intermediate Language) of the virtual machine of the dotNET framework.My input grammar comprises of  a (minimal)subset of the C++ language ( which is minimal enough to write a fairly descent program ) and certain Real time constructs ie,some constructs that aid in writing Realtime applications(as in the case of ADA) .
 
Since the constructs are less(I dont wanna take those complex  constructs like operator overloading,inheritance etc) i thought of embedding the code generation phase within the semantic analysis phase itself .
 
In some tools an option has been provided
 
sum  := prod                    {$$ = $1.val  ;Emit($$.val) }
            | sum+ prod         {$$ = $1 + $2} ;Emit(add)}
prod   := term                   {$$=$1.val }
           | prod * term 
term   := int
 
 
In this grammar (Yacc/Jay) it would be easy for generating the code.I mean by the time the rule sum gets executed, the value for prod gets calculated and can be emitted.But since the way we mention the grammar is different in ANTLR, how can one do that?
 
sum : = (prod PLUS)?  prod 
 
 Since the rules are combined together into one how can one generate different instructions differently for the rules.Please help me!!
 
2. Moreover consider the situation (Forgive me if the question is too trivial)
 
stmt   := intr : 
                   INT   {System.Console.WriteLine(intr.getText())
             PLUS
             PLUS
 
Had i written the rules like this
 
intr   :  INT  
stmt  :  intr PLUS PLUS
 
how can i emit the value of the INT .When i write the semantic action in stmt rule ,i get an error which says cannot return from another method intr()

Awaiting your reply,
Shomi

My first impression would be that with C++ as input language there's no
chance to support the full language in one pass. Instantiation of templates
and probably some other things with operator overloading will require a lot
of non-trivial processing.

C++ is very nasty to parse. Terence & David can probably give you more
advice on parsing C++.

I doubt wether that will work in one pass with a LALR parser as well. Again
it depends on how much of the C++ language you need to generate code for.

(Or am I misunderstanding you and you want to use antlr in C++ mode for
your project e.g. have antlr generate C++ files you compile and then
generate for you specific problem (not C++ as input) code)

Cheers,

Ric

Shomi--

All of these features have equivalents in ANTLR.  Check out 1.) rule return=
 values, 2.) the AST and Token getText() method, and 
3.) labels.  There are instances of use in the examples subdirectories: loo=
k at them, and read the documentation from www.antlr.org.  
Also, try to develop an understanding of ANTLR syntax trees--they really he=
lp to simplify translation.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Getting Column and Line in CPP AST's
Message-ID: <c0elgr+dt1i@eGroups.com>

In CPP mode, is source column/line info available to the tree walker?  I'm using antlr to generate the AST's and I don't see any way to 
access this information.

If this isn't supported or straight forward, is there any example code that describes how to do it in CPP?  I've seen a couple 
of examples in Java, but they seem to call classes (like super) not available in CPP.

Thanks,

Henry

Subject: [antlr-interest] Recognizing interesting productions amidst other text
Message-ID: <c0eid7+hqd3@eGroups.com>

Hello ANTLR savants,
    I have a corpus that consists of natural language text
interspersed with occasional strings representing times (e.g. "12:01
pm", "noon", "1 am") for which I have already built a working grammar
and parser.  *I'm not interested in parsing the natural language text*
-- I just want to capture whatever text appears between "time"
instances.
    I'd like to figure out a way to get Antlr to consider the text
("phrase") as this *very* loose pseudo-grammar:

phrase:
    (time (description)?)+;

time:
    numericTime | MIDNIGHT | NOON | other_cases_i'm_leaving_out;

description:
    nontime;

As I said, the "time"-related productions, which I've elided, do work,
and I'm hoping I can just drop them into this grammar as-is.  However,
I'm unable to come up with a workable definition of "description" or
"nontime" that works with them and doesn't create a mess of lexical
nondeterminism.  The ultimate goal is to apply it to a piece of text
like

"8:00 am Woke up, got out of bed.  9am Ran a comb across my head."

and have it produce time/text pairs like

[8:00, "Woke up, got out of bed.  "], [9:00, "Ran a comb across my
head."]

But recognizing the non-time text is beyond my laughable Antlr
(in)abilities.  I'm guessing that lexical predicates might provide a
way to do this, but I'd appreciate any and all tips you can offer.

Thanks!

The above needs some small tinkering probably for 2.7.2-3 check the custom
AST section in the docs for the extra's.

I tried the above last night but couldn't figure out the template error that I was getting:

Lines
         void initialize( RefPNode t )
         void addChild( RefPNode c )
     RefPNode down;
     RefPNode right;

all gave me the same error:

" 'ASTRefCount' : use of class template requires template argument list"

Although I can get along okay in C++, this is my first exposure to templates and I don't know what's 
going on here.  Is there something wrong with this code, or am I missing an include file or something else?

I also tried the example in the Custom AST section of the doc and ran into similar, but not identical template
problems.  Incidently, I am building under VC6.

Thanks again for your help!

Message-ID: <7FA7E094-5DC0-11D8-82E3-0003937618D8@apple.com>

Apparently I don't quite "get" syntactic predicates.  Does the 
predicate imply that the attached alternative will fire *only* if the 
predicate is true, or it only apply the predicate if the lookahead is 
otherwise ambiguous?  It appears to be the former, which seems lame.  
Here's my situation:

	x: a | b
	a: c | b d

(The real thing is far more complicated, but this is the basic 
problem.)  Naturally, I get an ambiguity warning here -- if it sees the 
stuff predicted by "b", it doesn't know whether to follow x-> a-> b e 
or just x-> b.  So, I put in a predicate:

	x: (b d)=> a | b
	a: c | b d

This doesn't work, however: if I give it something c-like, then it 
can't parse it -- it just completely ignores the a-> c production.  If 
I add a duplicate of x-> a without the predicate, I just get more 
ambiguity warnings.  What to do?  I don't want to break up the "a" 
rule, since the real thing is rather complicated, not to mention 
self-referential.  I suppose I could come up with a syntactic predicate 
for the duplicate x-> a rule, but it's going to be sort of large.  
Suggestions?

Hi Chris,

First thing: ANTLR only does the syn pred if the lookahead is 
consistent with that alternative; saves a lot.  Now, the second thing 
is that syn preds are of the form: (alpha) => beta and mean alpha will 
*always* and *completely* predict beta.  Note the "=>" means "implies". 
  In your example,

x : (b d)=>a
    | b
    ;
a : c
    | b d
    ;

you're saying that if you see a "b d" come down the road, match a.  It 
implicitly says that if you see c coming the line, it will *not* 
predict matching rule a.  You need:

x : (a) => a
    | b
    ;

and all will work.  It says "if you see a, it will match" which is 
bizarre, but you must control this backtracking as it can get out of 
hand when done automatically by ANTLR.

Does that makes sense?

Well, actually neither is quite correct.  Using your example (below)

ANTLR reasons as follows
1.)  Could it be a (normal alternative testing precedes synpred testing)?
2.)  If yes, does it match (b d)?
3.)  If and only if yes, it is an a; ignore all other alternatives.

If you can identify a minimal synpred, you can do something like adding a rule a_prime to be used just for the synpred:

a_prime
      :
      c | b B
      ;

and change your rule to

x  :
    (a_prime)=> a
    |   b
    ;

As long as a_prime is not otherwise referenced, you won't have any problems.  One of the nice features of LL parsing is that you can 
have "duplicate" versions of rules--unlike most LR parsers, if you expect an a in an LL parser, you only look for a.  That is useful for 
attaching different sets of actions to the same syntactic phrase to get context-dependent semantics.

I reworked the code found at http://www.imada.sdu.dk/~morling/issue4.htm and it now compiles with only one error:

error C2039: 'getLine' : is not a member of 'AST'

from the following segment of code:

// Following line has <PNode> added:
typedef antlr::ASTRefCount<PNode> RefPNode;
. . .
	void addChild( RefPNode c )
		{
		//BaseAST::addChild( static_cast(c) );
		BaseAST::addChild( static_cast<antlr::RefAST>(c) );
		}
	static antlr::RefAST factory( void )
		{
		//antlr::RefAST ret = static_cast(RefPNode(new PNode));
		antlr::RefAST ret = static_cast<antlr::RefAST>(RefPNode(new PNode));
		return ret;
		}
	RefPNode PNode::getFirstChild()
		{
		//return static_cast(BaseAST::getFirstChild());
		return static_cast<antlr::RefAST>(BaseAST::getFirstChild());
		}
	RefPNode PNode::getNextSibling()
		{
		//return static_cast(BaseAST::getNextSibling());
		return static_cast<antlr::RefAST>(BaseAST::getNextSibling());
		}
	void PNode::setLine(int l_)
		{
		lineNumber = l_;
		}
	int PNode::getLine(void) const
		{
		if(lineNumber != 0)
			return lineNumber;
		else
			{
			//if(static_cast(BaseAST::getFirstChild()) == NULL)
			if(static_cast<antlr::RefAST>(BaseAST::getFirstChild()) == NULL)
				{
				return lineNumber;
				}
			else
				{
				//return ( (static_cast(BaseAST::getFirstChild()))->getLine() );
	PROBLEM HERE >>>	return ( (static_cast<antlr::RefAST>(BaseAST::getFirstChild()))->getLine() );
				}
			}
		}

I believe the problem is due to the compiler looking for ->getLine() in a RefAST object, where it doesn't exist.  The only place in the 
antlr source code that I can find getLine() is in the RefToken class, but I don't see how to work that in here.  Also, I'm not sure if I 
made the basic changes properly (see commented code above).  Help would be greatly appreciated!

Incidently, I've tried to post this twice before today, but it didn't make it for some reason.  Hopefully this won't be a duplicate.

Hi Nijesh
Non Determinism exists when the parser generator is unable to identify which production to use uniquely. 
Suppose there are two productions in ur grammer which start with the same token, now while parsing ur file, if the parser encounters this token, then it will not be able to identify the production to be used.
If then else is a classic example of this nondeterminism.
Sometimes it can be solved by just increasing the lookahead value (k). But this increases the parsing time exponentially and does not always work.
Or you can set the greedy option true, in which case the parser looks for the largest possible match.
Otherwise you have to break these productions and re write them to avoid non determinism.
I hope it helps.

Hi !!
while generating .java file, antlr is showing some warnings related to
non-determinism .Can anybody explain what it is exactly ?
thanks in advance.

Subject: [antlr-interest] (unknown)
Message-ID: <c0jvi5+61l6@eGroups.com>

I have placed "SeeGramWrap-02.12.2004.tgz" on my webpage at
"http://members.tripod.com/~edcjones/pycode.html". SeeGramWrap parses
a piece of C code and the resulting parse tree is output in man and
machine readable form. The result can be used for program
transformations. Since a particular trnsformation algorithm may not
require all the information present in the tree, the user can select
what to output.

I use the C grammar "cgram.tgz" associated with ANTLR. See
"http://www.antlr.org/resources.html".

In "cgram" is a java program "TestThrough.java" which parses C code
into an AST then runs a tree grammar on the AST and outputs the
original code. The tree grammar is named "GnuCEmitter.g". I work with
this grammar because the terminal tokens are printed in the correct
order. I modified the grammar turning it into a template. A piece of
the original "GnuCEmitter.g" is:

----
structOrUnionBody
        :       ( (ID LCURLY) => i1:ID lc1:LCURLY   { print( i1 );
print ( "{" ); tabs++; }
                        ( structDeclarationList )?
                        rc1:RCURLY                  { tabs--; print(
rc1 ); }
                |   lc2:LCURLY                      { print( lc2 );
tabs++; }
                    ( structDeclarationList )?
                    rc2:RCURLY                      { tabs--; print(
rc2 ); }
                | i2:ID                     { print( i2 ); }
                )
        ;
----

The modified version is:

----
@structOrUnionBody
#        :       ( (ID LCURLY) => i1:ID lc1:LCURLY   { <@ i1 @> print(
"{" ); tabs++; }
                        ( structDeclarationList )?
                        rc1:RCURLY                  { tabs--; <@ rc1 @> }
#                |   lc2:LCURLY                      { <@ "{" @> tabs++; }
                    ( structDeclarationList )?
                    rc2:RCURLY                      { tabs--; <@ rc2 @> }
                | i2:ID                     { <@ i2 @> }
                )
        ;
----

In this template, strings of the form "<@ ... @>" will each be
replaced by a set of print statements. Sometimes the rule may also be
wrapped by prints.  The template is used in
"mystuff/emitter/insert_prints.py". If certain options are set, a "@"
or "#" at the beginning of line has a special meaning. If an "@" is in
front of the rulename, information is printed when the rule is entered
or exited. If a "#" is NOT at the beginning of a line, then only C
tokens are output, just as in the original "GnuCEmitter.g". If a "#"
is present, more information is output. Detailed documentation of this
process is in "mystuff/emitter/insert_prints.py". if "insert_prints.py
SOME SOME FULL" is run the result is:

----
structOrUnionBody
  { System.out.print( "(" ); print( "structOrUnionBody" ); }
        :  (
                ( (ID LCURLY) => i1:ID lc1:LCURLY   { 
currentOutput.print("(\"structOrUnionBody.0\", "); print( i1 );
currentOutput.print("), ");  print( "{" ); tabs++; }
                        ( structDeclarationList )?
                        rc1:RCURLY                  { tabs--; print(
rc1 ); }
                |   lc2:LCURLY                      { 
currentOutput.print("(\"structOrUnionBody.2\", "); print( "{" );
currentOutput.print("), ");  tabs++; }
                    ( structDeclarationList )?
                    rc2:RCURLY                      { tabs--; print(
rc2 ); }
                | i2:ID                     { print( i2 ); }
                )
           )
  { System.out.print( "), " ); }
        ;
----

If the original C program , "silly.c", is

----
int i;
----

The output of the modified emitter grammar is "silly.c.data":

----
<<OPEN>>
externalList
<<OPEN>>
externalDef
<<OPEN>>
declaration
<<OPEN>>
declSpecifiers
<<OPEN>>
typeSpecifier
<<OPEN>>
typeSpecifier.3
int
<<CLOSE>>
<<CLOSE>>
<<CLOSE>>
<<OPEN>>
initDeclList
<<OPEN>>
initDecl
<<OPEN>>
declarator
<<OPEN>>
declarator.0
i
<<CLOSE>>
<<CLOSE>>
<<CLOSE>>
<<CLOSE>>
;
<<CLOSE>>
<<CLOSE>>
<<CLOSE>>
----

This output can be processed by "printtree.py" to produce "silly.c.nest":

----
['externalList', 
 ['externalDef', 
  ['declaration', 
   ['declSpecifiers', 
    ['typeSpecifier', 
     ['typeSpecifier.3', 
      'int']]], 
   ['initDeclList', 
    ['initDecl', 
     ['declarator', 
      ['declarator.0', 
       'i']]]], 
   ';']]]
----

and "silly.c.src":

----
int i ;
----

If "silly.c.src" is put through the entire process itself we get
"silly.c.src.src" which is identical to "silly.c.src".

In the ".data" or ".nest" files the tokens from the original C code
are in the correct order. It is easy to recover ("int", "i", ";").

Subject: [antlr-interest] Filtering out html tags and other questions.
Message-ID: <20040214055044.62227.qmail@web40701.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,
 I have an input file which is quite like HTML,
I don't want any of the HTML tags but only the text in
the page. I am using something like

options { filter=HTML_TAG; }
...
...
protected
HTML_TAG
	:	'<' (~'>')* '>'
		(
			(	// the usual newline hassle: \r\n can be matched
in alt 1
				// or by matching alt 2 followed by alt 3 in
another iteration.
				//
				 options {
					generateAmbigWarnings=false;
				}
			:	"\r\n" | '\r' | '\n'
			) 	{ newline();}
		)*
	|	( "\r\n" | '\r' | '\n' ) {newline();}
	|	.

	;

which I picked from one of the examples given with
antlr. But whenever there is a tag like </html> the
above does not work. It borks at the "</".

My second problem is, I have two things in my grammar.
A "##" and a line beginning with a '#'. As in

#indtag=file.ext

## some text ##

The first one if a tag that I need much like a #define
statement. The other "##" is a marker to indicate the
start of my input data. How do I differentiate between
them ? I looked up most of the syntactic predicate
docs and previous mails and came up with this, but it
doesn't work.

file
    :   (
            data
        |   (
                ((HASH HASH)) => (HASH HASH) {
marker(); }
            |   IND_TAG
            )
        )+
        EOF

where IND_TAG is,

IND_TAG
    :   '#' (~('\n'|'\r'))* '\n'
    ;

I get this error message,
line 7:2: expecting ''#'', found ''i''
line 9:1: unexpected token: ##

Any suggestions ?

Thanks in advance,
Manju

Subject: [antlr-interest] Indeterminacies
Message-ID: <c0lt17+qtbn@eGroups.com>

I've gotten a lot more done on that grammar i was asking about, but
i'm still stuck on two points, and i was hoping that someone would be
willing to take the time to examine what i do have done and perhaps
offer some critiques on it overall, and also help me with the two
sticking points i have.

The grammar is a bit large, so for politeness' sake i put it on my
site at http://offline.pointclark.net/vcard.g , Feel free to snag it
and look at it.

Anyway, first thing is the two problems i'm having specifically:

First, there are indeterminacies in the grammar on lines 39-51 (5 of
them) that i don't get - i can't seem to get rid of them.

Second, there's a part of the vcard spec that essentially allows the
value for an item to be pretty much any format, so how do i look for
that?  When i reach the point in the line where there can be a value,
it could be plain text, quoted-printable, base64 encoded, or some
other as-yet unknown arbitrary encoding.  The only thing i do know at
this point is that i can pretty much be assured that everything
following a colon in the line will be a value of some kind, and
there's nothing else that comes after it.

With respect to other critiques, as far as i'm concerned, if you're
kind enough to take the time to examine this novice's work, i will be
more than happy to learn from you.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [antlr-interest] FEATURE REQUEST: std::stream -- remove
Message-ID: <BC54EAFC.2F22B%sunshine@public.kherson.ua>

Hi Terr,
Hi Rick,

I want ask you about one step for ANTLR 3.0

Rick, you are going to develop now new C++ sources as I know.

So I dream, that ANTLR C++ runtime sources of Lexer / Parser
depend NOT on std::streams, but on some C++ interface class of stream

    I_Istream
    I_OStream


And ANTLR distribution have include implementation of these interfaces for
STD::stream.

1) STD::streams will be encapsulated into this .cpp file only

2) we will get ability to use other implementations of streams if we need.

For example, in our Valentina DBMS we have own such stream interfaces,
And we have a lots of implementations of them
    Stream on STD file
    Stream on our own file class
    Stream on socket
    Stream on Cached Files.

As you know DBMS have caching, and we can use files via our own caching.
But because ANTLR depend on std::stream we cannot use caching files with it.
This put down performance.

So, please consider this feature.

I believe using of interfaces is flexible and good OO design feature.

  Hi,

I wonder if antlr 2.7.2 is compiled and run in java 1.1 environment. 
I tried to compiled it however, it keeps generating 100 errors.
   Thanks.

I beg to differ. I see the std::stream definition as an interface declaration, since there are many implementations of it. Therefore, I see no reason why ANTLR should implement another interface layer to encapsulate the std::stream interface.

The std::stream library was designed (IMHO successfully) to be easy to extend and tack on top of various input/output systems. Having such a standard greatly simplifies development in my case, instead of each library or project you use having it's own interface declarations. That only means that in your own project, you need wrappers to make all those stream interfaces work together, which is kind of ironic if most of them use the same stream implementation behind those interfaces.

I say ANTLR should stick to std::stream, whereas that is already such an interface as you describe, and a standard one too. Chances are that users already have std::stream wrappers for their custom streams (at least that has been my case).

Writing std::stream implementations is easy, usually only a matter of extending std::streambuf. -- In your case, writing a std::stream wrapper over your interfaces is also an option, and could benefit you in more librarires than just ANTLR.

This is a very good point, and I totally agree. However, in my opinion, std::stream is just an interface declaration (and a good one), not an implementation. For that we have SGI, Microsoft, etc.

I still not agree.

In the modern C++ exists 2 major conception:

    interfaces
    templates.    

Developer of good LIBRARY and FRAMEWORK must choose between them,
Or even mix them.

std::Streams are childs of STL and therefore are TEMPLATES.
std::stream IS NOT interface by its mean.

We in our project totally avoid using of STL classes.
Few reasons

1) we use many platforms and many compilers.
   Each compiler vendor provide own implementation of STL standard.
   You have NO guarantee that on some compiler some class do not have bug.
   Just look into release info of each C++ compiler!
   How many bugs are fixed in each new release.


2) second reason -- even modern C++ compilers still are not perfect on
TEMPLATES compilation. If you make
    #include <stream>

into almost empty .cpp file, the code size of this .obj file grow in about
100 KB in the LIBRARY.

If you have in project 1000 files then you get size blowing for NOTHING!
100MB thanks to STD classes. This is not acceptable for us.

On start we have wrap STD::stream by own own IStream interfaces,
As result only ONE .cpp file have grow to 100KB.   You see point?
And Now we ABSOLUTLY have THROW OUT usage of STL classes.


NOT STD::stream must be wrapper!!!
It self must be wrapped.


------
Back to ANTLR.

I am sure that ANTLR use just 2-4 simple calls to stream,
Read char, write char.

So it will be VERY EASY add SMAL interface,
And ONE SMALL implementation of this interface around std::stream.


Most probably nobody is going do this.
And today STL idea eat a lots of brains. Just look on BOOST.
Also great of course.

But NOT EVERYTHING must be made on TEMPLATES.
Interfaces are FAR FAR more powerful technique,
Especially for such projects as ANTLR.

Actually only the default CharBuffer relies on std::istream. The lexer
only uses InputBuffer mechanics to access it's input.

Erm why not write a custom InputBuffer for your caching stream (or for your
particular stream wrapper baseclass)? Have a look at the CharInputBuffer
for a simple example.

There are still many unknowns for the C++ support lib rewrite. I still have
to research unicode more. I would prefer not to make antlr depend on a
third party library (like IBM's unicode lib) but this may be unavoidable to
get good unicode support. I suspect there will be some template use to plug
different string backends into the lib (so people can easily have a 'lite'
version or a heavier 'unicode' version, I also see room for performance
improvements here with tweaks to the codegen and template parameters) 
Adding stream wrappers in this mix might be possible but it could well be
that they will complicate things.

It seems that the choice within your company to move out of the way of
streams is mostly due to cross vendor STL/compiler support. While I can
understand this decision I'm not sure wether its a good idea for antlr.
Eventually compilers and standard library will improve up to a point that
the issues you mentioned will dissapear. I'd rather engineer towards the
standard than towards making an own standard.

So in short I'd have to give a logical maybe as answer, adding/using
wrappers per default I'd rather not do. Making it easier to plug such
wrappers into antlr is not a problem (as long as they're sane and it does
not complicate things).

Cheers,

Ric

Hi Rick,

I already have answer this --
    we AVOID usage of STD classes in our project.
    on several reasons.

Only ANTLR MAKE us to include them.
And only in part of project where ANTLR present we use them.


> There are still many unknowns for the C++ support lib rewrite. I still have

We have made this work already for our Valentina database.
I believe that the best way -- IBM ICU library.

It works with all compilers and all platforms, Is free, open source.
It is best of the best. Even Apple have integrate it into latest MacOS 10.3


> I would prefer not to make antlr depend on a third party library (like IBM's

Yes. Especially IF you think about many platforms and many compilers.
Or you must write own wrappers for EACH OS.
No guarantee that ALL Oses work in the same way.

NOT COMPLICATE!

We already have done a lots of such work in Valentina.
I will be happy share with you our experience,
And our Unicode and stream sources.

Look. 

ANTLR still will work with STL !!!

Just STL class (streams and string) will be wrapped by FA?ADE interface.
ANTLR loose nothing!

But it win that EVERYBODY ELSE can make own implementation of new ANTLR
interface classes using something else than STD.

May be somebody works with wxWindows. This great framework have own String
class and own Streams. So why SOMEBODY must be forced also add to own
project STL classes???

And now we are FORCED to include STL classes because ANTL CANNOT be tuned to
avoid them. You see?

It needs just add SMALL interface classes

    I_Stream
    {
        read_char() = 0;
        write_char() = 0;
    };


And make all ANTLR code depended ONLY on this interface.

Again, I am sure that ANTLR use quite few calls to streams and to strings.
So you will need just 30-60 minutes to make IMPLEMENTATION of interfaces
around STL.

Hi!

Just wanted to let you know, that I am now able to link to antlr.dll. The 
error was in my code, I was assigning an null to an ASTRef instead of using 
an nullAST. Why static linking was working, and the dll linking was not 
working, I don't know.

Ruslan--

I think that you misinterpreted Ric's comment on InputBuffer.  The
dependency on streams does not occur until CharInputBuffer (an
InputBuffer subclass).  It would not be difficult to comment out the
istream constructors and use a custom InputBuffer subclass that does
not use streams.

Getting rid of std::string would be another matter--doable, but
probably not worth it.  Personally, I think that the decision to avoid
use of the standard library will bite you--I've been dealing with a
messy legacy application which predates the C++ standard and had no
template code before I introduced ANTLR.  There are many places where
an upgrade to using the standard library would have simplified the
code, and the classes written to provide string--there are two string
classes, neither of which is quite compatible with std::string--and
other capabilities complicate the maintenance problem.

As Ric points out, C++ compiler technology and standards compliance is
improving, and conformance has gotten pretty good.  Rather than
phasing out use of standard components from ANTLR, you might be better
off with a plan for phasing STL elements into Valentina to improve
maintainability as compiler maturity can be demonstrated.  It would
not be too difficult to come up with an adequate test suite for the
standard capabilities that you need supported by the compiler and
libraries.  Maintainability is a tough issue, and avoidance of
standard capabilities in favor of home-grown (proprietary) solutions.
 What happens when you and the other original developers move on?

Hmm,

As far as I see, in the constructor of Lexer we must give stream.

I have code in our project

Importer_Text::Importer_Text(
    I_Table_Ptr            inTable,
    I_Location_Ptr         inLocation,
    Const_I_PropertyContainer_Ptr inProperties )
:    
    mTable( inTable ),
    
    mStream( U2A( inLocation->get_Path() ).c_str() ),           <<<<<
    mLexer( mStream )                                           <<<<<
{
    ProcessProperties(inProperties);
}


Where 
        STD::ifstream         mStream;

But I will look more deeply on what you mean.
May be I miss that point.

Well, we use IBM ICU library, so we have unicode class String from ICU.
And therefore we DO NOT use std::string anywhere in the project.
Only place where we are FOCRED to do this -- ANTLR

Do you think it is good design of framework (I mean ANTLR)
If I cannot tune it?  IMHO this means BAD OO design.

Let me explain. Valentina database is famous by its SPEED.
We fight here for performance of each byte of code.

STL is great for development of general kind apps, with GUI,
Where size and speed not critical. But this is not a case for DBMS.
We want control every byte of code we write. We cannot depend on
implementation of particular compiler vendor.

We do have simple code.


Again we do HUGE project. And we take care SELF about utility classes that
simplify our life and coding. We have own arrays, strings, trees, streams.
They are highly optimized for our needs and tasks.

We use templates and interfaces. We use smart ptr and templates driven by
policies. We study all modern C++ concepts and tips, STL and BOOST.

> and the classes written to provide string--there are two string classes,

And correct. WE ARE FORCED now to have in our projects 2 classes
    std::string -> ANTLR
    IUC::String -> ICU

We are FORCED to do conversions between them when we send data to/from
ANTLR. Not pleasant. I want to be able to say to ANTLR in some way:
    Please use ICU::String class in ANTLR RUNTIME code.
    Please use UChar instead of char to support Unicode.
 
BTW, this is where idea of Rick to use TEMPLATED in ANTLR can work!!!
We can make template parameters

        TCHAR
        prefix  L"Unicode string"       "Not unicode string"
        class string

> As Ric points out, C++ compiler technology and standards compliance is

AGAIN! I DO NOT ask REMOVE STL from ANTLR !!!!!!!

I just ask WRAP it by fa?ade -- interface.
I.e. To use ideas of COM/CORBA technologies -- ANOTHER STANDARD.

I do not ask move away FROM STANDARD!
I ask just use BOTH MODERN STANDARDS:  templates AND interfaces.

Such combination is MUCH MORE powerful than just one of them.

If I will do this, Valentina will become 10-50 times slower.

ANTLR generates three different constructors:

Lexer(istream &)
Lexer(InputBuffer &)
and
Lexer(LexerSharedInputState)

The first is the one usually used, but neither of the other two
require an istream.  It is the only function in the generated .cpp
file to require an istream.

Take a closer look at the lib/cpp/antlr headers.  The C++ support
library could be modified to replace string with String without too
much effort.  Full unicode support is trickier--it might require
modification of the CppCodeGenerator--but not out of the question. 
It's just never quite made it to the top of Ric's "to do" list--his
support of ANTLR C++ is a public service provided as a side-effect of
his use of ANTLR in his research.

ANTLR's support libraries are replaceable/tunable--it just takes
effort.  ANTLR 2 is pretty messy internally, but the libraries (except
for Java) are cleanly abstracted from the code generator.

Moving 100% away from STL is not an option. You will have to keep a local
modified copy of ANTLR to get that. It is probably quite easy to make a
sed/perl/tcl script that patches the antlr runtime to use whatever
replacements you want (as long as they're STL'ish enough)

Although you seem to have missed the point of the custom InputBuffer (as
Loring pointed out). You will have to do a little bit more work to
initialize a lexer see for an example the calc example, one of the Main.c's
in it uses a different InputBuffer. You may have to remove the convenience
constructor from the lexer that uses a istream but that's a trivial change.
Not using istreams is easy even in the current runtime.

This is indeed the best candidate I've seen so far. But requiring it by

You're free to modify the ANTLR runtime. So forced is a big word. A facade
will mean that in all kinds of places an extra indirection will happen. I'd
rather use templates for this.

I don't particularly see it as a benefit of a library to use it's own
homecooked implementations of streams/vectors/whatever. C++ is about to
move out of that stone-age era. It looks like that even the biggest STL
saboteur (Microsoft) finally made a decent compiler and with the many
platforms gcc is available on people should not have an excuse to use a
stone-age compiler/stdlib. Now we can only pray that Microsoft switches to
ELF and gets rid of the bad joke called DLL's then I'll be happier.

> And make all ANTLR code depended ONLY on this interface.

I'd suggest you have a look at InputBuffer.hpp and friends. It's basically
what you suggest.

Moving away from std:string does not really appeal to me. Making the string
class configurable via template parameters will almost certainly happen in
a runtime rewrite. Then again patching std::string out of the runtime with
a sed/perl/tcl script is probably doable in an hour.

Cheers,

Ric

I had a small patch here:
         http://www.trump.net.au/~rjc/antlr/index.html

Use the build instructions specified on the page, and it should work ok.

I think the latest 2.7.3 release candidate incorporates this patch(or 
equivalent).

:-) you have answer self.

It tooks many years for MS get this,

Of course we cannot wait, so we do self TOOLs we need in our project.

Yes. TEMPLATE will work.

If I will be able in template parameter tune ANTLR

Hi Chris,

I've just had a quick look and your nondeterminism may be avoided by 
changing the params rule:

params
:
	( SEMI ( WS )* param )+
	;


Note the change from * to +
Your original params rule could have matched nothing, which is 
usually to be avoided.

HTH,
Lubos.

Fascinating.  If I modify the search to "parser generator C++", I still get ANTLR #1 with Spirit (BOOST) #2.  If I do "parser generator 
java", I get CUP first, then ANTLR, then javacc.  ANTLR is also #1 for C#.

Weird.  Yeah, then on IE on my same Mac os x box, I get ANTLR as #3 for 
parser generator.  Weird. Two linux boxes showed ANTLR #1...

Howdy folks,

I'm looking for another student project to hand out and I'm thinking 
that something with python would be great as I have to teach Python 
next Fall ;)  Better learn the syntax first, right? ;)

Does anybody need a python grammar or do we have one lurking somewhere 
already?

I think Google take into account the your browser platform

I've got a translator from Python's "Grammar" BNF spec to ANTLR (look in your "Grammar" subdirectory of Python-x.x.x).  I also have 
an undebugged lexer.  I've been planning to complete them for testing parse tree grammars, but haven't gotten there yet.

Hi Loring,

You mean you have a tool that auto converts the grammar to antlr?  I 
just used emacs by hand ;)

I'll have a look.

Yep.  Something I wanted to play with.  I figured that a grammar translator had longer term value and would be generally more 
useful--and it took less effort than debugging a manually translated grammar would have.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Problems building 2.7.2
Message-ID: <c0voa4+3dbr@eGroups.com>

Hi,

I have had problems building this version. (Java run-time I got
working, but I am building so as to get the C++ run-time library.)

I also notice that 2.7.3 is coming soon and wondered if the problems I
found have been fixed, or could possibly be fixed, for that release !!
(I could not see a bug-traking DB anywhere).

1) The homepage says to use Java 1.1 or better: I could not get the
Java run-time to run with our default 1.1.3 version as utils.HashSet
is missing. From what I can see on the web this only arrived in Java
1.2. So I am using another machine with Java 1.3 and ANTLR runs OK.
Perhaps the docs/homepage should be updated ?

2) So now to building: I got:
make
...
java -cp /home/skellett/local/src/antlr-2.7.2/antlrall.jar antlr.Tool
  antlr.g
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: antlr/Tool
make[1]: *** [.antlr.g] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/skellett/local/s
rc/antlr-2.7.2/antlr'
make: *** [subdirs] Error 2

The problem is that antlrall.jar does not exist anywhere. After
googling I followed some advice on
http://homepage.mac.com/gerard_iglesias/iblog/ and copied antlr.jar to
 antlrall.jar to get me going. Is this OK ?

3) As I had messed around a lot I started with a new install from the
.tar, did a ./configure, copied the .jar file and make and it went OK.
Now I get:
make install
Installing jar files into /home/skellett/local/share/antlr-2.7.2
/bin/sh: ../scripts/install-sh: not found
/bin/sh: ../scripts/install-sh: not found
/bin/sh: ../scripts/install-sh: not found
make: *** [install] Error 1

Any ideas ?

Thanks, Simon Kellett

Think that's fixed in the pre release.

Grab the prerelease or a current develsnapshot. 2.7.2's configure is borked
there's workarounds (see archives) but it's way easier to grab the
prerelease.

Cheers,

OK. I tried this, although I am not too happy using an rc for "real
work " :-) I got antlr-2.7.3rc2.tar.gz from the home page, and I now
get a different error :-)

make

make: *** No rule to make target `antlr/debug/misc/ASTFrame$1.class',

I could not find anything on this forum. Is there anywhere else I
could look (eg a developers forum or email list ?)

Thanks, Simon

Hrm the search on yahoogroups is not one of the best I guess.

This is about the best place to look since all developers watch this list.

Could you try editing the toplevel Makefile around line 240 there's a list
of class files put the ASTFrame.class in front of the things with dollar
signs.

Ric

Yep - I removed the 2 classes with the $'s in and it all built OK. And
running the example work too (java antlr.Tool test.g where test.g is
the example from the quick-start on the homepage). I just hope the
missing 2 classes will not create problems down the line !!

Thanks, Simon

This might give you trouble in java mode. Although it's an optional helper
class.

Looks like you don't have a 'install' program installed? What did configure
generate for your scripts/Config.make ?

(Replying to my own post with a dirty work around !!)

> /bin/sh: ../scripts/install-sh: not found

If I edit scripts/Config.make and change the line to:

INSTALL  = scripts/install-sh -c

I get a *bit* further: to a "scripts/install-sh: not found" !!

INSTALL  = /home/skellett/local/src/antlr-2.7.3rc2/scripts/install-sh -c

Works !!

It looks like different parts of the install process work from
different levels in the directory tree so a relative path does not
work. I can not see how create a generic path !!

Hi Ric

> This might give you trouble in java mode. 

OK - thanks. I will only be using C++ code generation.

> Looks like you don't have a 'install' program installed?

I checked the logs:

configure:3278: checking for a BSD-compatible install
configure:3332: result: scripts/install-sh -c

But I do have (on SPARC/Solaris 8):
> which install
/usr/sbin/install

> What did configure generate for your scripts/Config.make ? 

INSTALL  = scripts/install-sh -c

So for some reason configure did not like my "install" and also the
install-sh fallback is also broken !!

But I think I am good-to-go for my development !!

Thanks, Simon

Okies, thanks for the feedback. I'll try and patch up the configure script.
I *hate* things (configure) that try to be intelligent.

And java is happy !! It looks like the .class files need to be

Hi,
Try adding the jar file to classpath 
export CLASSPATH="/home/skellett/local/share/antlr-2.7.3/antlr.jar"

I guess then it should work. 

The .jar is similar to .zip and contains files with relative directory structures. When u add it to the 
classpath, java searches into this directory structure.

Aravind.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Tedious newbie lexer question re keywords and identifiers - antlr 2.7.2
Message-ID: <c104o3+oaf5@eGroups.com>


I have 2 problems,

1. I need to recognise lots of keywords with common prefixes ( k=10 
has silenced the warnings coming from that one ), I also need to 
treat most other things as identifiers, although I'm using 
testLiterals=true, I'm still getting warnings about lexical non-
determinism (simple cut-down example follows) :- 

PLSQL.g: warning:lexical nondeterminism between rules ALL and 
IDENTIFIER upon
PLSQL.g:     k==1:'a'
PLSQL.g:     k==2:'l'

2. If I take the generated parser/lexer and run it, I get 
things like ALLWORDS being treated as 2 tokens, ALL and IDENTIFIER
(value WORDS) instead of one token of type IDENTIFIER and value 
ALLWORDS, which is what I want.  I'm also getting misbehaviour from
antlr which seems to give up parsing the input correctly.

I have a reasonable degree of expertise in lex and yacc and was 
hoping antlr would eventually seem easier to use than those 2 tools.
Please say it is !

Subject: [antlr-interest] Trouble with comma separated list
Message-ID: <20040218200924.18870.qmail@web12702.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I've written the following simple grammar to process a
list of 'where's.

//BEGIN GRAMMAR
class P extends Parser;

startRule
  :
  item_list;

item_list:
  item  { System.out.println("item_list : item"); }
(COMMA item)*  { System.out.println("item_list :
(COMMA item)*"); }
    ;
  
item : WHERE  { System.out.println("item : WHERE"); }
;

class L extends Lexer;

tokens
{
  WHERE = "where";
  COMMA = ",";
}

NAME options { testLiterals=true; } : (',' |
'a'..'z'|'A'..'Z')+ {  } //NEWLINE
  ;

// Whitespace -- ignored
WS	:	(	' '
		|	'\t'
		|	'\f'
			// handle newlines
		|	(	options {generateAmbigWarnings=false;}
			:	"\r\n"  // Evil DOS
			|	'\r'    // Macintosh
			|	'\n'    // Unix (the right way)
			)
			{ newline(); }
		)+
		{ _ttype = Token.SKIP; }
	;
//END GRAMMAR

This handles input of the following form:

'where , where , where , where'

but chokes on something like:

'where , where, where'

In other words it requires that there be a space
between the 'where' token and the ',' token.  I
understand why this is happening but it's not clear to
me how to fix it.  If anyone can point me towards the
relevent option (or some other solution), I'd greatly
appreciate it.  Thanks.

Very nice!  Thanks for doing this and posting about it.  Was there any
reason for doing it?  Working on an editor, perhaps?

Subject: [antlr-interest] SeeGramWrap (2nd try)

I have placed "SeeGramWrap-02.12.2004.tgz" on my webpage at
"http://members.tripod.com/~edcjones/pycode.html". SeeGramWrap parses
a piece of C code and the resulting parse tree is output in man and
machine readable form. The result can be used for program
transformations. Since a particular trnsformation algorithm may not
require all the information present in the tree, the user can select
what to output.

I use the C grammar "cgram.tgz" associated with ANTLR. See
"http://www.antlr.org/resources.html".

In "cgram" is a java program "TestThrough.java" which parses C code
into an AST then runs a tree grammar on the AST and outputs the
original code. The tree grammar is named "GnuCEmitter.g". I work with
this grammar because the terminal tokens are printed in the correct
order. I modified the grammar turning it into a template. A piece of
the original "GnuCEmitter.g" is:

----
structOrUnionBody
: ( (ID LCURLY) => i1:ID lc1:LCURLY { print( i1 );
print ( "{" ); tabs++; }
( structDeclarationList )?
rc1:RCURLY { tabs--; print(
rc1 ); }
| lc2:LCURLY { print( lc2 );
tabs++; }
( structDeclarationList )?
rc2:RCURLY { tabs--; print(
rc2 ); }
| i2:ID { print( i2 ); }
)
;
----

The modified version is:

----
@structOrUnionBody
# : ( (ID LCURLY) => i1:ID lc1:LCURLY { <@ i1 @> print(
"{" ); tabs++; }
( structDeclarationList )?
rc1:RCURLY { tabs--; <@ rc1 @> }
# | lc2:LCURLY { <@ "{" @> tabs++; }
( structDeclarationList )?
rc2:RCURLY { tabs--; <@ rc2 @> }
| i2:ID { <@ i2 @> }
)
;
----

In this template, strings of the form "<@ ... @>" will each be
replaced by a set of print statements. Sometimes the rule may also be
wrapped by prints. The template is used in
"mystuff/emitter/insert_prints.py". If certain options are set, a "@"
or "#" at the beginning of line has a special meaning. If an "@" is in
front of the rulename, information is printed when the rule is entered
or exited. If a "#" is NOT at the beginning of a line, then only C
tokens are output, just as in the original "GnuCEmitter.g". If a "#"
is present, more information is output. Detailed documentation of this
process is in "mystuff/emitter/insert_prints.py". if "insert_prints.py
SOME SOME FULL" is run the result is:

----
structOrUnionBody
{ System.out.print( "(" ); print( "structOrUnionBody" ); }
: (
( (ID LCURLY) => i1:ID lc1:LCURLY {
currentOutput.print("(\"structOrUnionBody.0\", "); print( i1 );
currentOutput.print("), "); print( "{" ); tabs++; }
( structDeclarationList )?
rc1:RCURLY { tabs--; print(
rc1 ); }
| lc2:LCURLY {
currentOutput.print("(\"structOrUnionBody.2\", "); print( "{" );
currentOutput.print("), "); tabs++; }
( structDeclarationList )?
rc2:RCURLY { tabs--; print(
rc2 ); }
| i2:ID { print( i2 ); }
)
)
{ System.out.print( "), " ); }
;
----

If the original C program , "silly.c", is

----
int i;
----

The output of the modified emitter grammar is "silly.c.data":

----
<<OPEN>>
externalList
<<OPEN>>
externalDef
<<OPEN>>
declaration
<<OPEN>>
declSpecifiers
<<OPEN>>
typeSpecifier
<<OPEN>>
typeSpecifier.3
int
<<CLOSE>>
<<CLOSE>>
<<CLOSE>>
<<OPEN>>
initDeclList
<<OPEN>>
initDecl
<<OPEN>>
declarator
<<OPEN>>
declarator.0
i
<<CLOSE>>
<<CLOSE>>
<<CLOSE>>
<<CLOSE>>
;
<<CLOSE>>
<<CLOSE>>
<<CLOSE>>
----

This output can be processed by "printtree.py" to produce
"silly.c.nest":

----
['externalList',
['externalDef',
['declaration',
['declSpecifiers',
['typeSpecifier',
['typeSpecifier.3',
'int']]],
['initDeclList',
['initDecl',
['declarator',
['declarator.0',
'i']]]],
';']]]
----

and "silly.c.src":

----
int i ;
----

If "silly.c.src" is put through the entire process itself we get
"silly.c.src.src" which is identical to "silly.c.src".

In the ".data" or ".nest" files the tokens from the original C code
are in the correct order. It is easy to recover ("int", "i", ";").

Subject: [antlr-interest] Recognizing interesting productions amidst other
text

Hello ANTLR savants,
    I have a corpus that consists of natural language text
interspersed with occasional strings representing times (e.g. "12:01
pm", "noon", "1 am") for which I have already built a working grammar
and parser.  *I'm not interested in parsing the natural language text*
-- I just want to capture whatever text appears between "time"
instances.
    I'd like to figure out a way to get Antlr to consider the text
("phrase") as this *very* loose pseudo-grammar:

phrase:
    (time (description)?)+;

time:
    numericTime | MIDNIGHT | NOON | other_cases_i'm_leaving_out;

description:
    nontime;

As I said, the "time"-related productions, which I've elided, do work,
and I'm hoping I can just drop them into this grammar as-is.  However,
I'm unable to come up with a workable definition of "description" or
"nontime" that works with them and doesn't create a mess of lexical
nondeterminism.  The ultimate goal is to apply it to a piece of text
like

"8:00 am Woke up, got out of bed.  9am Ran a comb across my head."

and have it produce time/text pairs like

[8:00, "Woke up, got out of bed.  "], [9:00, "Ran a comb across my
head."]

But recognizing the non-time text is beyond my laughable Antlr
(in)abilities.  I'm guessing that lexical predicates might provide a
way to do this, but I'd appreciate any and all tips you can offer.

Thanks!

Subject: [antlr-interest] Switching between literals and keywords


I have a language that I am preparing a grammer for. The language sometimes
has dual uses for some of the tokens.

For instance, I sometimes have to match keywords like "integer" in the
following phrase:
"define integer constant HostNameLength = 20;"

In this case, I match this phrase with the following:

protected
defineIntegerConstant
	:	"define" "integer" "constant" ID EQUAL  INT ((SEMI)=>SEMI)?
	;


But then I sometimes I have other phrases where I don't won't the "integer"
keyword returned as the LITERAL_integer, but instead returned as a
IDENTIFIER. For example in the following phrase, the word integer could be
any type: integer, ObjectPtr, float, boolean, string, etc. In the example
below, I need to match "update" COLON ID ID

"define object message EvaluateForFrozen (
	update: integer mfail);"

How do I get the lexer to return a INDENTIER instead of a LITERAL_integer?

Thanks, Bob

Subject: [antlr-interest] multiple slashes
Message-ID: <c1192s+fn2v@eGroups.com>

Hi all,

I need to parse a language that treats forward slash '/' as both a 
delimiter and as the divide character.

identifiers can be standalone or have the forward slash joining them 
together

foo

or

/foo/bar/car

so we can have instances of

/foo/bar/car.zoo/a     <---- z/foo/bar/car.oo is being divided by a

or

foo/bar          <---------- foo divided by bar

or

a//foo/bar/car.zoo  <------- a divided by /foo/bar/car.zoo

in my grammar i have a rule

expression
    :    identifier ( DIVIDE identifier)
    ;

in my lexer I have a rule

identifier
    :    alpha
    |    delimited_identifier
    ;

divide
    :    '/' ( {_ttype=delimited_identifier } alpha ( '/' alpha )* )?
    ;

alpha options { testLiterals=true; }
   :    'a' .. 'z' ( 'a' .. 'z' | '0' .. '9' | '_' | '$' | '#' )*
   ;
these rules can match

/a/b//c    <---- /a/b divided by /c

but cannot match simple examples such as a/b

any ideas?

I am working on one based more directly on the C# spec, but it is competing
with other 'real' work at the moment, so it will take a bit more time... I
have the lexer, types, expressions, namespaces, enums, and attributes more
or less done so far, so a ways to go still...

Actually I have a question too - attribute arguments in C#  have the format:
(positional_arguments COMMA named_arguments)
which inside the parens look something like:

(expression (COMMA^ expression)*)
COMMA
(IDENTIFIER ASSIGN expression (COMMA! IDENTIFIER ASSIGN expression)*)

This does get weird, because (x=5), x==5, or x+=5 can be considered
positional arguments, yet x=5 can't. Also assignment expressions (id=expr)
are naturally valid expressions, so you have to somehow exclude those until
the second half, and then allow only them. I can get all the things parsed
(in fact using only positional_arguments will parse everything), but I'm
having trouble disallowing sets that aren't in the right order, say like:

( 5, 6, x=7, 8) // the last two args needed to be switched

So anyway, mostly my question is - are there cases where you just give up on
parsing with grammar, and break into code and check things manually? Or is
that the kind of check that is better left to a later pass? Or is there just
some magic cleverness I'm missing? I've tried with different groups of LA
lookahead, =>,  greedy settings, and extra rules, but I can't seem to get
the right combo going.

All and any general guidance muchly appreciated : ).

Cheers,
robin

If I recall correctly he either had to do most of the work in the lexer or
he simply returned characters from the lexer and did quite a bit of lexing
in the parser.

is it possible to write a parser for FORTRAN 77 with ANTLR?

I mean a parser for real life F77 code
not only few lines constructed code.

Also note that I used a f77 grammar to convert f77 to thinking machines 
fortran during my postdoc 10 years ago.  I can find the (PCCTS) 
grammar, but it was perhaps not a real front end as it only was tested 
on a single application of fluid dynamics.

Want it?

I would recommend, as you say, parse generously and validate later, either
at the end of the rule or in a tree pass.

I am working on one based more directly on the C# spec, but it is competing
with other 'real' work at the moment, so it will take a bit more time... I
have the lexer, types, expressions, namespaces, enums, and attributes more
or less done so far, so a ways to go still...

Actually I have a question too - attribute arguments in C#  have the format:
(positional_arguments COMMA named_arguments)
which inside the parens look something like:

(expression (COMMA^ expression)*)
COMMA
(IDENTIFIER ASSIGN expression (COMMA! IDENTIFIER ASSIGN expression)*)

This does get weird, because (x=5), x==5, or x+=5 can be considered
positional arguments, yet x=5 can't. Also assignment expressions (id=expr)
are naturally valid expressions, so you have to somehow exclude those until
the second half, and then allow only them. I can get all the things parsed
(in fact using only positional_arguments will parse everything), but I'm
having trouble disallowing sets that aren't in the right order, say like:

( 5, 6, x=7, 8) // the last two args needed to be switched

So anyway, mostly my question is - are there cases where you just give up on
parsing with grammar, and break into code and check things manually? Or is
that the kind of check that is better left to a later pass? Or is there just
some magic cleverness I'm missing? I've tried with different groups of LA
lookahead, =>,  greedy settings, and extra rules, but I can't seem to get
the right combo going.

All and any general guidance muchly appreciated : ).

Cheers,
robin

Subject: [antlr-interest] AST construction in C++
Message-ID: <c132cd+me63@eGroups.com>

Hi,

I've been trying to get a simple parser/lexer working in C++ with
buildAST = true.  I'm missing something and I don't know what it is. 
Given the following grammar:

test.g
====================================================================
options { language = "Cpp"; }
class test_parser extends Parser;
options { exportVocab = test_; buildAST = true; }
test : (line)* ;
line : ID EQUALS Number SEMI ;
class test_lexer extends Lexer;
options { k = 2; exportVocab = test_; }
EQUALS : '=' ;
SEMI   : ';' ;
WS	   : (' '|'\t'|'\n')
{$setType(ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)Token::SKIP);} ;
Number : ('0'..'9')+ ;
ID     : ('a'..'z')+ ;
====================================================================

and the following C++:

main.cpp
====================================================================
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include "test_lexer.hpp"
#include "test_parser.hpp"

using namespace std;

int
main ( int argc, char **argv )
{
  ostringstream ost;

  ost << "a = 1;" << endl << "b = 2;" << endl << "c = 3;" << endl;

  istringstream  ist(ost.str());
  test_lexer     lexer(ist);
  test_parser    parser(lexer);
  parser.test();

  return 0;
}
====================================================================

I build with antlr 2.7.2 as

antlr test.g
g++ -g -Wall *.cpp -o test -lantlr

and run ./test, which dumps core.  It doesn't dump core if I turn off
buildAST.  Stack trace shows the problem is somewhere in AST code, I'm
failing to initialize something.  Can someone show me what lines of
C++ I need to add to main.cpp to get the program to build ASTs without
segfaulting?  I would really appreciate the help.  Thanks-

-dave

Boy that's weird.  It might help if you spell the rules out in English, like
"if you start with a slash then you've started an identifier", etc.  First
figure out how you would do it by hand.  Once that is clear we can help you
express it in antlr.

Hello,

I just picked up ANTLR and I'm trying to determine the easiest way to

Java source files. I have the Java grammar available on the ANTLR web
site and I have the source files from the TokenRewriting article also
on the site. Could someone walk me through where in the Java grammar I
should put logic to do the insert? I really need help on this and I
appreciate any and all help provided.

Have you considered using ant(see the replace task) or sed or something to 
do this?

IF you you antlr possibly you could just lex it provided you knew the 
version string you were looking for was unique enough  Otherwise you will 
need to parse it and then search through the resulting AST, do the replace 
then print the AST  out again....remembering to preserve whitespace etc

Yep, sed would work if the variable was always on the same line 
completely specified.

The rewrite engine works great.  Just add an action to the rule(s) that 
match a member variable that replaces the expr token(s) with the text 
of what you want. :)  If you're new to parsers and grammars, it may be 
easier to just go the sed route.

I found references to Sinan Karasu with Google.

I search for the email address

but Sinan did not respond.

Looks like you forgot about the ASTfactory for example code check in the
examples subdir of the distro (calc example would do)

Thank you everyone,

The thing is I'm new to both grammar engines and sed. So to me it's
the lesser of two evils. I've gotten a little further in this as I've
been able to figure out the Java grammar a little more. So far I've
narrowed where my mods go to the variableDeclarator rule. This is what
I have so far:

It gets a little hairy because the "stuff" I want to replace is not
defined as tokens in the grammar, rather they're defined as parser
rules. The rewrite engine example shows replacment using tokens but I
don't know how to get an accurate token count from the two AST objects
 at this point. I know the one (#d) is really just a place holder as
there will be no array declaration here but the other does not seem to
be yielding the right amount of child nodes. I think I'm at a
misunderstanding here (child-nodes != tokens)? When I run everything
with my above mods I get something like the following:
public final static String VERSION"MODIFIED!"= "2.3";
 where it clearly looks like the node count is evaluating to one and
the token count is much higher (accomodating for whitespace and such).
I don't want to hard code this because the version assignment may not
always be a simple assignment. It could be an expression and I want to
be able to replace the whole expression. Could you steer me in the
right direction here?

Subject: [antlr-interest] keywords testLiteral=true
Message-ID: <c15n56+mva5@eGroups.com>

Hi all,

In my lexer I have a rule SLASH_IDENTIFIER that calls my IDENTIFIER 
rule.  However in the SLASH_IDENTIFIER rule, I get keywords that come 
out of my IDENTIFIER rule.  When I call the IDENTIFIER rule in the 
parser, I do not get keywords.

for example,

SLASH_IDENTIFIER matches this
/foo/keyword

however IDENTIFIER does not match
keyword

class SqlLexer extends Lexer;

options {
    exportVocab = Sql;
    testLiterals = false;
    k = 2;
    caseSensitive = false;
    caseSensitiveLiterals = false;
//    charVocabulary = '\3' .. '\177';
    charVocabulary='\u0000'..'\uFFFE';
}

tokens {
    keyword = "keyword";
}

IDENTIFIER options { testLiterals=true; }
    :    'a' .. 'z' ( 'a' .. 'z' | '0' .. '9' | '_' | '$' | '#' )*
    ;

DIVIDE
    :    '/'  { $setType(SLASH_IDENTIFIER ); }
               ( IDENTIFIER ( '/' IDENTIFIER )* )?
    ;

IDENTIFIER and DIVIDE have the same lookahead for IDENTIFIER.  So the lexer
is choosing DIVIDE instead of IDENTIFIER.  When DIVIDE calls IDENTIFIER it
overwrites the returned token type with its own.

Best solution is to make IDENTIFIER protected and test for literals in
DIVIDE (and not in IDENTIFIER).

I think I finally got it! I just start with the index of the
identifier under the variableDeclarator rule and advance past the
white space to get my starting point. I then advance to the SEMI token
to get my stopping point and viola! Heres what I have so far:

variableDeclarator![AST mods, AST t]
	:	id:IDENT d:declaratorBrackets[t] v:varInitializer
		{
		    //*CCC- scan here for version indentifiers and replace the
initializer with the new value.
		    if(id.getText().equals("VERSION"))
		    {
		        int start = ((TokenWithIndex)id).getIndex() + 1, stop = start;
		        TokenWithIndex next = engine.getToken(start);
		        //Skip white space...
		        while(next.getType()==WS) {start++; next =
engine.getToken(start);}
		        //Advance to SEMI identifier...
		        stop = start;
		        while(next.getType()!=SEMI) {stop++; next =
engine.getToken(stop);}
                stop--; //Don't include the SEMI in the replacement.
		        engine.replace(start,stop,"= \"MODIFIED!\"");
		    }
		    #variableDeclarator = #(#[VARIABLE_DEF,"VARIABLE_DEF"], mods,
#(#[TYPE,"TYPE"],d), id, v);
		}
	;

Whew! I thought this would've ended up to be over a week-long project
but Ive only spent a couple days. All I need now is to parameterize
the whole thing so it can be a usefule re-usable component. Thnax
everyone!

I changed my identifier rule to be protected, but my SLASH_IDENTIFIER 
rule still absorbs up my keywords

IDENTIFIER options { testLiterals=true; }

Last Stretch:

I have everything working wonderfully and now I'm in the home stretch.
I need a clever way of doing one of the following:

Either remove an inserted version string after detecting an already
coded one. (RewriteEngine.rollback()? How does this work?)
Or inserting the version strings at all pre-recorded classBlock
indices after reaching end of file and not finding them. I perferr the
1st option if possible as it seems cleaner. However I think I might be
able to hack the second option. Any suggestions?

Thanx in advance,
Cliff

Hi Cliff,

I wouldn't rely on the rollback feature as I merely added to indicate 
it's a good idea, not that I'd really done "transactions" properly ;)  
I think you can do your own by simply doing a remove on the appropriate 
insert instruction in the instruction stream for the rewrite engine.

If you come up with somethign cool, let me know and i can stick it into 
the engine :)

I just installed (or tried to) antlr 2.7.2 on hp-ux 11i and tried to 
build the c++ runtime. Ran ./configure but when I ran make I get the 
following error:

Make: line 8: syntax error.  Stop.

Which make variant is expected to be used for the build?

Thanks in advance!

GNU make is the default expectation.  I would actually suggest using one of the 2.7.3 release candidates (either 2.7.3rc2 from the 
www.antlr.org site or Ric's latest C++ snapshot (http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr/) since Ric has done some work on 
cleaning up the configure script since 2.7.2.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Working in Russia
Message-ID: <c17c91+cs6t@eGroups.com>

Dear friends,

I would like to ask you for the hale, or rather for the advice. 
What would you do if you were me ?
I'm Andrew, 27 yers old, from Poland.

Recently I've received the job proposition in the fondation (no meter 
the name) which activity is 
financed by the European Union and some athers french fondations. The 
job would be in the accounitng and administration of this fondation.
This fondation brings help (medical) in some regions in Russia 
sinistrated by the war or the natural catalclisms.
Actually the bring attention in the region of Ingushetia. My work 
will consist on accounting and financial affairs in Poland 
(supervision of financial flow from Eu and France)
and especially in the administrative domaine. The problem is that in 
Russia this humanitar help has already been developped to the 
significant level - it must be well controled - especially 
the trafic of documents must be specified (and controled), some 
internal procedures must be created, I will be responsible of 
external contacts wiyh some russian institutions (especially with the 
Russian Ministry of helth).
My hesitation comes from the fact that I will have to be in place 
(will share my time between Warsaw - Moscow - Ingushetia), wille be 
there 3 weeks a month - the forth weej of the month will be completly 
for me (kind of compensation).
Place of work - Shared between Warsaw, Moscow amd Ingoushetia. Warsaw 
(the city where I'm living), Moscow (it's wanderfull city - I would 
like to see it); but Ingushetia - I'm "a little" affraid. Having the 
frontiere with Tchechenia, it's seems to dangerous.
I'm aslo afraid of this system 3/1 - it can perturbate my private 
live - it's really diffucult to led my life nirmally.

>>From the other hand it can be the great opportunity to survive 
something interesting - Travel, meet people and gain some 
professional experience and earn some maney (it's good paid).
It isn't for a long time (max for some years 3-4)

Actually I'm on unemplyement, will probably start an ather job 1st 
march - but nothing interesting and bad paid (with the same 
perspectives in the future).

So what do you thing ?
Please send me all your commentaries, is it worth or no.
I would be especially freatfull for the answers from people living in 
Russia (Russian).

Thanks Andrew
PS You can answer me in french or english

I downloaded 20040115 and got gnu make running so I got a lot further 
now, but I'm getting this error:

Try rebuilding the jar file. (e.g. rebuild all the java files) or if that's
an option use a newer java runtime (1.4 will do).

Subject: [antlr-interest] anybody help with me a python grammar rule?
Message-ID: <404FF626-64DC-11D8-BCA5-000A95891192@cs.usfca.edu>

Folks, the formal parameter list for functions looks wacky in the 
distribution and on the net.

First the grammar in the distribution:

varargslist: (fpdef ['=' test] ',')* ('*' NAME [',' '**' NAME] | '**' 
NAME) | fpdef ['=' test] (',' fpdef ['=' test])* [',']
fpdef: NAME | '(' fplist ')'
fplist: fpdef (',' fpdef)* [',']

The one from the doc is

parameter_list ::=
              (defparameter ",")*
                 ("*" identifier [, "**" identifier]
                 | "**" identifier
                   | defparameter [","])

defparameter ::=
              parameter ["=" expression]

sublist ::=
              parameter ("," parameter)* [","]

parameter ::=
              identifier | "(" sublist ")"

My question here is why have the final '| defparameter [","]' alt in 
parameter_list????  Surely it's redundant (might have to move a comma, 
but...)

Can anybody give me some examples of the various things parameters 
might look like in the wacky cases?

Thanks!

For example, won't this rule generate the same language?

parameter_list:
     defparameter (',' defparameter)*
     ( ','
       ('*' NAME [',' '**' NAME]       | '**' NAME
       )
     )
  | '*' NAME [',' '**' NAME]
  | '**' NAME

and it's LL(1).

arglist has the same problem.  I wonder what kinda parser they build 
from this grammar.  Ick.

I could be wrong, but I think that is one kind of lookahead antlr doesn't
handle ; ).

Okay... I rebuilt the jar file and got a little further. I'm now 
getting this error during the make (BTW, I'm using aC++, the HP-UX 
supported compiler)

Building ASTFactory.o
Error 419: "../antlr/ASTFactory.hpp", line 75 # 'istream' is used as 
a type, but has not been defined as a type.
    st ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(std)string& txt, ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(std)
istream& infile );

I looked at the file ASTFactory.hpp and inserting the following in 
line 17 seems to fix the problem. Can someone tell me why this would 
work in other compilers? ie. where is the istream header included?

#include <istream>

I'm getting a different error now and I'm still trying to track 
what's causing it. More to come...

-Jerry

* determined to get this to work in hp-ux aC++ =)

def foo(x,y,z):  #GOOD

def foo(x,y,z,): #GOOD trailing comma allowed

def bar(*baz):   # STILL GOOD

def bar(*baz,):  # BAD Syntax error !!

i.e. You're allowed a trailing comma in a parameter list, unless you're
using either of the excess positional parameter forms.  Though I won't
to pretend to answer why this should be the rule ;-)

How does this match a param_list not ending in one of the 'excess
parameter' forms?

foo(a) or foo(a,)

I think you'll need the form they've used (or something similarly
complex) to get the optional trailing comma on simple parameters, but
not on *'d ones.

John

Subject: [antlr-interest] Working in Russia
Message-ID: <c1avhn+q0to@eGroups.com>

ear friends,

I would like to ask you for the hale, or rather for the advice. 
What would you do if you were me ?
I'm Andrew, 27 yers old, from Poland.

Recently I've received the job proposition in the fondation (no meter 
the name) which activity is 
financed by the European Union and some athers french fondations. The 
job would be in the accounitng and administration of this fondation.
This fondation brings help (medical) in some regions in Russia 
sinistrated by the war or the natural catalclisms.
Actually the bring attention in the region of Ingushetia. My work 
will consist on accounting and financial affairs in Poland 
(supervision of financial flow from Eu and France)
and especially in the administrative domaine. The problem is that in 
Russia this humanitar help has already been developped to the 
significant level - it must be well controled - especially 
the trafic of documents must be specified (and controled), some 
internal procedures must be created, I will be responsible of 
external contacts wiyh some russian institutions (especially with the 
Russian Ministry of helth).
My hesitation comes from the fact that I will have to be in place 
(will share my time between Warsaw - Moscow - Ingushetia), wille be 
there 3 weeks a month - the forth weej of the month will be completly 
for me (kind of compensation).
Place of work - Shared between Warsaw, Moscow and Ingoushetia. Warsaw 
(the city where I'm living), Moscow (it's wanderfull city - I would 
like to see it); but Ingushetia - I'm "a little" affraid. Having the 
frontiere with Tchechenia, it's seems to dangerous.
I'm aslo afraid of this system 3/1 - it can perturbate my private 
live - it's really diffucult to led my life nirmally.
The main source of my hesitation it's of course this region 
Ingoushetia - it seams dangarous, non?

>>From the other hand it can be the great opportunity to survive 
something interesting - Travel, meet people and gain some 
professional experience and earn some maney (it's good paid).
It isn't for a long time (max for some years 3-4)

Actually I'm on unemplyement, will probably start an ather job 1st 
march - but nothing interesting and bad paid (with the same 
perspectives in the future).

So what do you thing ?
Please send me all your commentaries, is it worth or no.
I would be especially greatfull for the answers from people living in 
Russia (Russian).

Thanks Andrew
PS You can answer me in french or english or spanish

Message-ID: <1B8B1E0A-6591-11D8-BCA5-000A95891192@cs.usfca.edu>

Howdy folks,

In case anybody wants to try out my lab (or you can wait til tuesday to 
see the solution), here is the description for tomorrow's lab:

http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~parrt/course/652/labs/python.html

They will take the python BNF specs from the distribution and the 
website (parser and lexer) and build a translator that generates an 
equivalent ANTLR spec :)  I provide the complete infrastructure, in 
1:45 hours the students must add TokenStreamRewriteEngine operations to 
perform the syntax-directed translation.

After they have completed the lab, the students will use the output as 
the starting point for their next project: build a python parser.  Then 
I suppose we'll need to do symbol table actions and then perhaps 
translate it to something. :)

Message-ID: <20040224090100.76881.qmail@web40705.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,
    I am filtering some html elements in the lexer,
but whenever I see a particular pattern I want that to
be known in the parser. How do I set a variable (in
C++ code) in the lexer and access it in the parser.
Also is there a way I can add variables and methods to
the lexer and parser class ? Like the main parser and
lexer class that is generated, can I add my own
methods and variables to that ? And probably access
the variables in the lexer class in the parser ?

Thanks,
Manju

Did you read the C++ runtime docs? It's in the doc directory of the
distribution.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Lexer for comments
Message-ID: <c1g149+pbvp@eGroups.com>

The documentation for ANTLR gives a variant of the following as an
example for parsing C-style multi-line comments:

class L extends Lexer;
options {k = 2;}
Comment : "/*" ( options { greedy = false; } : . )* "*/" ;


I have a specification for a lexer where everything except the
multi-line comment can be parsed with k == 1 lookahead. I assume that
setting k = 2 will slow down parsing for the rest of my grammar. So I
was wondering whether the following might work. Parsing comments may
be a bit slower now, but I'm thinking as long as there are few
comments in my source I would be faster overall, due to k == 1.

class ADLLexer extends Lexer;
options {k = 1;}
Comment : "/*" ( ( '*' ~'/') => '*' | ~'*' )* "*/" ;


Are there other alternatives?

Uli

Uli--

The k value used by ANTLR is a maximum lookahead--if k=1 suffices for a given rule, then only one token of lookahead is used for that 
rule regardless of the value that you have assigned k.

You probably have no rule which references x--ANTLR automatically assumes that x will be invoked as an entry point to the grammar.

Thanks but that's not the problem.
Try the following.  The generated Java makes sense if
you change the parser rule to x:(A)(B)*;

class XParser extends Parser;
options {
 buildAST = false;
}
startRule :
      (x       {System.out.println ("x");} 
      |b:B     {System.out.println ("b");}
      |eof:EOF {System.out.println ("eof");});
x:(A)(B)?;
class XLexer extends Lexer;
A:'a';
B:'b';

Ooops...yeah, I guess that should be optional...rats.  Thought I'd 
figured that one out.

Python is seeming very cool in it's power and expressivity, but pretty

Your grammar is obviously for a language where A *must* be followed 
by B or EOF. What else can follow A?

HTH,

Subject: [antlr-interest] Custom AST types in 2.7.3rc2 (C++)
Message-ID: <c1ibfn+bnqr@eGroups.com>

Has anyone got this working ? I have been following the example in the
Manual ("C++ Notes"). My C++ is not briliant but have found what I think
are some problems with the example, but I still get stuck.

1) Example confuses between (Ref)My_AST and (Ref)MyAST (note the
underscore).

2) There appears to be a circular dependancy between My_AST/MyAST
Ref_MyAST/RefMyAST class and typedefs.

In my code (in addition to following the manual) I have:
1) removed the underscore
2) added "class LmpAST;" before the typedef
3) in my .g file I added #include "LmpGrammer.hpp" to the parser

But I get lots of strange errors when the parser compiles (full path
cut):

"...lib/cpp/antlr/BaseAST.hpp", line 15: Error: Namespaces cannot be
declared in a class scope.
".../lib/cpp/antlr/BaseAST.hpp", line 19: Error: Template ASTRefCount
is not defined.

Any pointers greatly appreciated :-)

Regards, Simon

Hi,

I've got a problem with an ANTLR generated lexer. The input contains a 
character which is not in the characters to be known by the lexer. Say it's 
';'. When the lexer scans the input it recognizes the character and throws 
the RecognitionException, which I can catch in the lexer and print its 
contents. But when the following code fragment:

		catch (ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)RecognitionException& e) {
				throw ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)TokenStreamRecognitionException(e);
		}

tries to "re-throw" the exception as a TokenStreamRecognitionException, then 
the program is aborted. gdb-stackbacktrace:

(gdb) bt
#0  0x003a1c32 in _dl_sysinfo_int80 () from /lib/ld-linux.so.2

    at buispecLexer.cpp:189

The line 189 of buispecLexer.cpp is exactly the line with the re-throw above.

Stats: I'm using ANTLR 2.7.2 on a Pentium IV, Fedora Core 1, Kernel  
2.4.22-1.2140.nptl, and gcc (GCC) 3.3.2 20031022 (Red Hat Linux 3.3.2-1). 

Do I miss something? I try to catch all exceptions, i.e. std::exception in the 
calling main-function, but the program does not care.

Do you any further information? Is this problem known already?

Greetz,

Do you catch ANTLRExceptions in your main as well ? ANTLR's exceptions are
not derived from std::exception.

OK, let me try again.

I have a large grammar which works fine. Lexer rules of the form 
A:'a'('b')? and A:'a'('b')* both generate the expected 
implementation (in Java).  A parser rule of the form x:A(B)* also 
works as expected.  

However, when I added a parser rule of the form x:A(B)?, ANTLR 
generated a switch statement which requires an EOF in the case there 
is not a B.

Is this a bug or a feature?

Thanks.

Whooops, I must have missed that information. Yes, thanks, catching 
ANTLRException in main solves the problem.

I use it daily ;) I think I updated the docs with respect to custom ast's
after rc2 release though. I'm not sure if it had big inconsistencies. A
superfluous underscore might have slipped in. Anyway I just added a new
snapshot to my snapshots page:

http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr/

This also includes a extended treewalk example that uses a customAST with
line number support. That one should work out of the box and has all the
bells and whistles to use a custom AST.

This does look weird.. Though it could be due to some mistake/typo earlier.
Another option is that you're using an exotic compiler? Anycase give the
above snapshot a spin and let me know if it works.

Cheers,

Ric

I have fixed my namespaces error: it was caused by my trying to fix
this problem:

I added "ASTLabelType = "RefLmpAST";" to my parser options section
which causes the xParser.hpp to be generated with an entry:

protected:
	RefLmpAST returnAST;

But the C++ compiler does not know of type RefLmpAST:

"LmpParser.hpp", line 52: Error: Type name expected instead of
"RefLmpAST".

How do I persuade the C++ code generation to add a #include of the
header file containing *my* AST type (ie defining type RefLmpAST) ?

Thanks, Simon

Add a header section see the top of examples/cpp/treewalk.g :

header {
#include "MyAST.h"
}

See also the 'Inserting Code' section of the cpp-runtime.html.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Newbie question reg. expression grammar
Message-ID: <c1iin6+g0o8@eGroups.com>

Hi,
I'm trying to get the hang of grammars, parsers etc.

I started by reading the excellent introduction to Antlr by Ashley 
Mills. 
(http://supportweb.cs.bham.ac.uk/documentation/tutorials/docsystem/bui
ld/tutorials/antlr/antlrhome.html)
Starting with the simple expression evaluation example, I found 
the "implementation" of nested expressions (chap. 9.1) a bit awkward, 
as it requires brackets around all expressions.

So I tried to change the grammar to this: 

class ExpressionParser extends Parser;

options { buildAST=true; }

expr      : sumExpr SEMI;
sumExpr   : prodExpr ((PLUS^|MINUS^) prodExpr)*; 
prodExpr  : powExpr ((MUL^|DIV^|MOD^) powExpr)* ;
powExpr   : atom (POW^ atom)? ;
atom      : INT 
          | LPAREN^ expr RPAREN! ;

class ExpressionLexer extends Lexer;

PLUS  : '+' ;
MINUS : '-' ;
MUL   : '*' ;
DIV   : '/' ;
MOD   : '%' ;
POW   : '^' ;
SEMI  : ';' ;
LPAREN: '(' ;
RPAREN: ')' ;
protected DIGIT : '0'..'9' ;
INT   : (DIGIT)+ ;

{import java.lang.Math;}
class ExpressionTreeWalker extends TreeParser;

expr returns [double r]
  { double a,b; r=0; }

  : #(LPAREN a=expr)       { r=a; }
  | #(PLUS a=expr b=expr)  { r=a+b; }
  | #(MINUS a=expr b=expr) { r=a-b; }
  | #(MUL  a=expr b=expr)  { r=a*b; }
  | #(DIV  a=expr b=expr)  { r=a/b; }
  | #(MOD  a=expr b=expr)  { r=a%b; }
  | #(POW  a=expr b=expr)  { r=Math.pow(a,b); }
  | i:INT { r=(double)Integer.parseInt(i.getText()); }
  ;

Now simple expression without brackets are parsed correctly, but even 
(3+5);
yields a unexpected token error, which I don't understand.
I tried to understand the problem by utilizing the article "Debugging 
and Testing Grammars [...]" 
(http://www.antlr.org/article/parse.trees/index.tml) by Mr. Parr and 
got the following list of 
derivations: 

derivation:
    <expr>
 => <sumExpr> EOF
 => <prodExpr> EOF
 => <powExpr> EOF
 => <atom> EOF
 => ( <expr> EOF EOF
 => ( <sumExpr> ; EOF EOF
 => ( <prodExpr> + <prodExpr> ; EOF EOF
 => ( <powExpr> + <prodExpr> ; EOF EOF
 => ( <atom> + <prodExpr> ; EOF EOF
 => ( 3 + <prodExpr> ; EOF EOF
 => ( 3 + <powExpr> ; EOF EOF
 => ( 3 + <atom> ; EOF EOF
 => ( 3 + 5 ; EOF EOF

I don't understand why there's a second(!) EOF and why the derivation 
from atom to (expr) doesn't work... :(
Could somebody give me a hint, please?

Thanks in advance,
Andreas

Subject: [antlr-interest] Newbie question reg. expression grammar

Hi,
I'm trying to get the hang of grammars, parsers etc.

I started by reading the excellent introduction to Antlr by Ashley 
Mills. 
(http://supportweb.cs.bham.ac.uk/documentation/tutorials/docsystem/bui
ld/tutorials/antlr/antlrhome.html)
Starting with the simple expression evaluation example, I found 
the "implementation" of nested expressions (chap. 9.1) a bit awkward, 
as it requires brackets around all expressions.

So I tried to change the grammar to this: 

class ExpressionParser extends Parser;

options { buildAST=true; }

expr      : sumExpr SEMI;
sumExpr   : prodExpr ((PLUS^|MINUS^) prodExpr)*; 
prodExpr  : powExpr ((MUL^|DIV^|MOD^) powExpr)* ;
powExpr   : atom (POW^ atom)? ;
atom      : INT 
          | LPAREN^ expr RPAREN! ;

class ExpressionLexer extends Lexer;

PLUS  : '+' ;
MINUS : '-' ;
MUL   : '*' ;
DIV   : '/' ;
MOD   : '%' ;
POW   : '^' ;
SEMI  : ';' ;
LPAREN: '(' ;
RPAREN: ')' ;
protected DIGIT : '0'..'9' ;
INT   : (DIGIT)+ ;

{import java.lang.Math;}
class ExpressionTreeWalker extends TreeParser;

expr returns [double r]
  { double a,b; r=0; }

  : #(LPAREN a=expr)       { r=a; }
  | #(PLUS a=expr b=expr)  { r=a+b; }
  | #(MINUS a=expr b=expr) { r=a-b; }
  | #(MUL  a=expr b=expr)  { r=a*b; }
  | #(DIV  a=expr b=expr)  { r=a/b; }
  | #(MOD  a=expr b=expr)  { r=a%b; }
  | #(POW  a=expr b=expr)  { r=Math.pow(a,b); }
  | i:INT { r=(double)Integer.parseInt(i.getText()); }
  ;

Now simple expression without brackets are parsed correctly, but even 
(3+5);
yields a unexpected token error, which I don't understand.
I tried to understand the problem by utilizing the article "Debugging 
and Testing Grammars [...]" 
(http://www.antlr.org/article/parse.trees/index.tml) by Mr. Parr and 
got the following list of 
derivations: 

derivation:
    <expr>
 => <sumExpr> EOF
 => <prodExpr> EOF
 => <powExpr> EOF
 => <atom> EOF
 => ( <expr> EOF EOF
 => ( <sumExpr> ; EOF EOF
 => ( <prodExpr> + <prodExpr> ; EOF EOF
 => ( <powExpr> + <prodExpr> ; EOF EOF
 => ( <atom> + <prodExpr> ; EOF EOF
 => ( 3 + <prodExpr> ; EOF EOF
 => ( 3 + <powExpr> ; EOF EOF
 => ( 3 + <atom> ; EOF EOF
 => ( 3 + 5 ; EOF EOF

I don't understand why there's a second(!) EOF and why the derivation 
from atom to (expr) doesn't work... :(
Could somebody give me a hint, please?

Thanks in advance,
Andreas

Well, if your x rule is NOT referenced in any other parser rule, 
ANTLR assumes it is a top-level rule and as such it can be called 
directly from your main(). Now if you take a look at the rule 
definition, it is clear that token A will be processed followed by 
the optional B. That's it => B/EOF switch. I consider this a feature, 
not a bug but I could possibly be missing your point.

HTH,
Lubos.

I really appreciate your trying to help but request you to please 
look at the generated Java. I understand that ANTLR will put in a 
test for an EOF if I don't put one in.  However, this test is at the 
highest level of alternatives.

The problem I am encountering is that ANTLR interprets the (B)? as 
requiring either a B or an EOF directly after the A.  In other 
words, it won't handle the case where there are two A's.  It works 
fine if I use x:A(B)* which isn't what I want, however. 

startRule :
      (x:A(B)? 
      |b:B  
      |eof:EOF 
      );

If (B)* works, then so should ( B | ).  That may solve your immediate problem.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Confusion with protected lexer rules
Message-ID: <20040225201830.17886.qmail@web12705.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,

The following is a small excerpt of my grammar:

//BEGIN EXCERPT
protected REG_ID: ALPHA_CHAR ( ALPHA_CHAR | DIGIT )* {
System.out.println("Jason REG_ID"); }
  ;
protected ALPHA_CHAR: ('a'..'z' | 'A'..'Z') {
System.out.println("Jason ALPHA_CHAR"); }
  ;
protected DIGIT: ('0'..'9') {
System.out.println("Jason DIGIT"); }
  ;
protected ID: REG_ID { System.out.println("Jason:
ID"); }
//END EXCERPT

None of these rules are firing.  If I remove the
'protected' keyword from REG_ID everything behaves as
I'd expect but then of course a token gets returned to
the Parser which I don't want.  So, the is there any
way I can get the lexer to recognize these rules
without ever sending a token to the parser?  If push
comes to shove I can ignore the token in the parser
but I'd rather keep the solution confined to the
lexer.  Thanks in advance for any thoughts you may
have.

Are you referencing those rules anywhere? It seems to me your ID rules
shouldn't be protected, but it depends what you want. If you want to get
that one but then ignore it in the stream you can use:
{ _ttype = Token.SKIP; }
like usually done with whitespace...

I'm a little confused; do you think that the above
should match more than one 'A' optionally followed by
a 'B'?  Wouldn't that be:

startRule : (A)+(B)? } B } EOF;

Subject: [antlr-interest] Lexer speed comparison
Message-ID: <c1j9ci+99vp@eGroups.com>

I ran some tests comparing Lexers generated by different tools in
terms of speed. The sophistication of my Lexer specification that I
used as input for the Lexer generators is about that of a lexer for C.
The average numbers I found by repeatedly running the generated lexers
on a large source file were these:

ANTLR           8300ms
JLex            6500ms
JFlex 1.4pre5   2000ms
Flex            1900ms

I used current versions of all tools. For the ANTLR comparison I had
to adjust the Lexer specification, but tried to make it as efficient
as possible. For the Flex comparison, I basically called Flex's
yylex() function from Java via JNI. Also in the case of Flex I
generated fewer Java objects as output than for the others, and if I
take that into account, Flex's time would probably be more similar to
JFlex's.

I was surprised to find that ANTLR generated the slowest lexer.
Naturally, when interpreting these numbers keep in mind that the
outcome may have been different on a different lexer specification or
lexer input text. On the other hand, it makes sense to me that a DFA
would be faster on average than a more powerful recursive-descent parser.

Are there other performance numbers available? I have not been able to
dig up anything substantial. I also wonder how ANTLR-generated LL(k)
parsers perform compared to LALR(1) parsers.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Changing parser/lexer base class?
Message-ID: <c1ja2l+i6hc@eGroups.com>

Hello,

I wonder if there is a way to change the base classes that the parser
and lexer extend from. My project has a bunch of lexers/parsers based
on different grammars, but sharing a lot of common behavior (ASTs,
error reporting, etc.) It would make things much easier and help avoid
a lot of code duplication if I could insert a layer between, say,
LLkParser and my parser.

Thanks,
Gleb

Hi Uli,

Thanks for running some tests.  Unfortunately, it reveals what I've 
suspected.  There are two problems areas with ANTLR's lexers:

(1) generally huge overhead since I'm mimicking LL parsing
(2) my nextToken generates a poor approximation to a DFA for predicting 
which rule will succeed

I have an interesting solution to this problem for ANTLR 3 that works 
in my prototype (that is, the algorithm computes the right stuff).  It 
merges DFAs to get speed and simplicity of specification and then uses 
full parsing when you need it :)

One of the big areas that will get attention in 3.0 is speed. :)

BTW, i'm building a lexer for Python at the moment and boy will it be 
SLOWWW! ;)

Subject: [antlr-interest] nullASTptr linkage and ASTNULLType implementation
Message-ID: <c1jat5+fa20@eGroups.com>

I am attempting to compile ANTLR 2.7.2 using Visual C++ 6.0 and the
supplied project and workspace files.  Having searched for the
following errors in the FAQ, online, and in the group archives, I hope
these aren't repeated questions.

First:
Compiling BaseAST.cpp gives me the following error:
> baseast.cpp(312) : error C2201: 'nullASTptr' : must have external
linkage in order to be exported/imported

But in its declaration, in AST.hpp(148), it's not declared static:
> extern ANTLR_API AST* const nullASTptr

Second:
Having solved that problem temporarily by making nullASTptr non-const,
I then run into the problem that ASTNULLType has no method
implementations.  Am I missing an implementation file (I have the
.hpp header)?

Thanks,
Kjerken

a. Did you use flex -F or -f ?

b. Did you try to eliminate I/O time in some way (e.g. by parsing
from memory rather than a file) ?

c. Did the java tools time require 8-bit => 16 bit conversion or
were they 8 bit character scanners or was code conversion done
only once before the timing loop ?

d.   Did you allow "warm-up" time for the jit ?

It was in 2.7.2 but had a bug.  It works in 2.7.3 soon to appear.

class P extends Parser("mypackage.MyParser");

Hi Tom,

Good questions.

Also, did you have testLiterals=false in your Lexer options?  WIth that 
as true, it does a hashtable lookup for each token.

I understand it might not be possible, but it would be really be interesting
to look at your different grammars and see what you have done (or others
would do) to try to optimize and speed things up. I have what is probably
the worlds slowest C# lexer/parser right now, and I've been scouring google
for hints...

Cheers,
Robin

x:(A)(B)? should match (A)(B) or simply (A) in the case when there 
is not a (B) immediately following (A).  However, this is not what 
happens.  Try it.

Hi Monty,

this didn't help.
The derivation now looks like:
derivation:
    <expr>
 => <sumExpr> EOF
 => <prodExpr> EOF
 => <powExpr> EOF
 => <atom> EOF
 => ( <expr> EOF EOF
 => ( <sumExpr> ; EOF EOF EOF
 => ( <prodExpr> + <prodExpr> ; EOF EOF EOF
 => ( <powExpr> + <prodExpr> ; EOF EOF EOF
 => ( <atom> + <prodExpr> ; EOF EOF EOF
 => ( 3 + <prodExpr> ; EOF EOF EOF
 => ( 3 + <powExpr> ; EOF EOF EOF
 => ( 3 + <atom> ; EOF EOF EOF
 => ( 3 + 5 ; EOF EOF EOF

*sigh*

Stupid mistake!!! (or rather stupid me :( )

I defined expr as
expr      : sumExpr SEMI;

and atom as 
atom      : INT 
          | LPAREN^ expr RPAREN! ;

A nested expression with this grammar needs to be terminated by a 
semicolon -- not what I intended...

   Hi, 

I tried to write my own custom AST Node type which stores the line 
and column number during the parsing process and print out that 
information in the tree walking process. 
   I have it working with the Java parser however it doesn't work 
with the C# parser. All the line number is 0 and column is -1. 
   Do you know what's wrong. As I mentioned earlier, I got it 
working with the Java parsing but not the C# one.

Grab a prerelease or snapshot then try again.

Latest repository snapshot is available at

http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr 

That one should by now compile flawlessly on VC6. (DLL's not supported)

Not very surprised myself ;) ANTLR generates horrible code for lexers. I'm
not sure how big the impact is of the recursive descent parsing/lexing
style, but I would not be surprised if I could handoptimize an ANTLR lexer
to the level of JLex. ANTLR generated code is wasting a lot of time calling
match methods where the outcome is already known.

BTW it's a pity you did not test C++ mode next to the Java mode.

Not much only some random tests done by people over time. It would be nice
if you could share the input files for these lexers for future reference.

Cheers and thanks for sharing this info!

I'd call it a nasty quirk for now. Only workaround I've seen is adding a
dummy rule which says anything may follow x:

dummy: x ( . )* ;

MiMi,

What version of ANTLR are you using?. You should be using 2.7.3.rc2
since it has extended support for this very issue. Note that you
*must* apply the fix described in this post for C# to work in the
2.7.3rc2 version:
    http://groups.yahoo.com/group/antlr-interest/message/10766)

Additionally, it would help if you either described what you did with
the Java and C# versions or, post the relevant snippet(s) of C# code
that is misbehaving.

Cheers,

Micheal
ANTLR/C#

As I said I might be missing your point completely thus I apologize 
in advance in case my help is misleading.

I assure you that I have used your example to generate the parser and 
I have seen the issue in the source code you are talking about.

Using your rule (I removed the EOF alternative):
startRule :
       (x:A(B)?  
       |b:B  
       );

you will get:
		...
		try {      // for error handling
			{
			switch ( LA(1)) {
			case A:
			{
				x = LT(1);
				match(A);
				{
				switch ( LA(1)) {
				case B:
				{
					match(B);
					break;
				}
				case EOF:
				{
					break;
				}
				default:
				{
					throw new NoViableAltException
(LT(1), getFilename());
				}
				}
				}
				break;
			}
			case B:
			{
			...
			...


Your worry is the EOF case after the first B case, right? Here I can 
only repeat what I have written before. A (based on the grammar) can 
only by followed by B or EOF.

Now for instance if you add a rule:

topRule: (startRule)*;

You will apparently get a nondeterminism (ignore for now) but note 
the change in the genereted code for startRule:

		...
		try {      // for error handling
			{
			switch ( LA(1)) {
			case A:
			{
				x = LT(1);
				match(A);
				{
				if ((LA(1)==B)) {
					match(B);
				}
				else if ((LA(1)==EOF||LA(1)==A||LA(1)
==B)) {
				}
				else {
					throw new NoViableAltException
(LT(1), getFilename());
				}
				
				}
				break;
			}
			case B:
			{
			...
			...

I know this is not the best example but I hope it is clear now what 
ANTLR tries to do and why it does so.

HTH,
Lubos.

Thanks for the feedback.

a. I did not use flex -F or -f. I used it out of the box, like "flex
myspec.lex"
b. I parsed from memory.
c. I used as input whatever the tool asked for and was easy to
implement. ANTLR, JLex, and JFlex each got a Reader (reading from a
char array in memory), Flex got a character array (via
yy_scan_bytes()). In the ANTLR, JLex, and JFlex specifications I
specified 8-bit character sets.
d. All initialization (calling constructors, initializing Flex, etc.)
was done outside the timing loop. Inside the loop, I only made the
calls to retrieve the next token. I ran each test a number of times
with similar results on each run.

I did not set testLiterals=false. My grammar has keywords. I guess I
could alternatively recognize them by setting the lookahead to
something like k=10. But would such a large lookahead really speed
things up?

Unfortunately I am not able to publish the proprietary specification I
used (it's a real-world grammar that my company uses for its
products). But as I indicated, it is not terribly sophisticated. I
would expect similar results, for example, with a lexer spec. for (a
subset of) C or Java. Perhaps someone would be interested in running
such tests?

One can turn off for grammar and then turn on again in the IDENTIFIER 
rule so that it changes token types for keywords properly. :)

Yeah, try it out if you have time with the testLiterals thing changed 
per the above.

Comparison with hand-written code.
I test two parsers for rc-files:

1. Antlr/C++-based (lexer+parser).
2. Hand-written (C++) (lexer+parser+tree generator).

Results:

Antlr/C++-based - 0,85 Mb/s.
Hand-written (C++) - 11,4 Mb/s. (second run pure lexer speed is about 70
Mb/s).

Antlr-generated code cannot used directly in real commercial projects
because it too slow. Antlr maybe used only for debug and research grammars.

Antlr/C++ 2.x has some handbrakes:
1. Lexer generator that produce slow code. What about re2c?
2. try/catch blocks in parser-generated code. What about return bool?
3. Antlr not use special fast strings, std::string not so fast.
4. Antlr not use allocators (allocators may speed up whole parser speed
about 3-4 times).
5. Antlr pointers use two pointers scheme
"pointer->pointer_with_counter->object", scheme
"pointer->object_with_counter" is faster.

Oh, I see the problem.  It's that you have SEMI in your expr rule.  When
atom tries LPAREN expr RPAREN notice that expr requires a SEMI (before
LPAREN).
Try:

atom      : INT 
          | LPAREN^ sumExpr RPAREN! ;

Mda.... Bad news.

I did not expect so huge difference.

Alex, it seems speed of ANTLR bother only you an me,
I.e. People from Russia and Ukraine :-)

I also during last 2 years have raise SPEED issue many times on this list.
Usually people answer -- we more care about correctness than of speed.

I answer, but what problems to have and CORRECT and SUPER-FAST parser
:-))

Alex, seriously, 

As you know Rick is going to start development of new C++
engine for ANTLR 3.0

You can take BIG PART in this process.
Unfortunalty I cannot help too much.
I am no expert on parsers, and busy on other tasks.

What I can do -- we have grow here SQL92 grammar for Valentina db,
And in nearest months we will grow system of regression benchmarks for it.
This will be of course used with profiler. So we can do profiling and
reporting what is not good.

As I know, exceptions are used for complex features of ANTLR,
That with bool result will be very complex for coding.

STD people say it is.

Yes, this can be fact.

Just go ahead and show to ANTLR developers how this can be done.

Right, intrusive pointers are faster.

Or if to use conception of interfaces -- I_Unknown + smart_ptr
Is great tool

I agree - ANTLR seems to work pretty well (correctness), but what we need
now is SPEED!

We've got ANTLR in a couple of our products, but they parse mainly small
files.  Sometimes, however, we will have to parse large files, and I think
we'll have some customer complaints from that.

So, the slowness is a big issue here as well.

We can also offer to contribute to the C++ code generator work, if that
helps.  Especially if some smaller pieces can be broken off and worked on
separately.

Regards,

- Tom

Do you use a lot of syntactic predicates?  Those will destroy 
performance for sure.

I don't think so. I am no expert on parsers too. And I am busy on other
tasks too. Ric want to add garbage collector. This is very hard task for
C++. Match simpler add allocator for fixed-size objects (objects with
variable length like strings may be separated by power of 2) and use smart
pointers. + hash code for strings.

Bool + error state (int). Bool sign that something wrong and need
backracking or choosing another branch. Error state used for analyse how to
propagate error: in this rule (in most cases skip tokens before guard
tokens) or in upper rule.

This is a real fact for C++ preprocessor.

Forget about 6-th handbrake.
6. Antlr use std::stream, faster load whole file into memory and than parse
it.

Subject: [antlr-interest] C# parser - first pass
Message-ID: <004001c3fcac$dbf84040$0100a8c0@xpbaby>

I have the first pass of the C# parser, modeled on the C# specs done. It
just parses at this point - eg it doesn't break things into trees etc, so
obviously it isn't very useful. On the bright side it is easier to read ; ).
There are a few constructs it is still having trouble with (mostly the antlr
generated C#, if that counts, he he), and it only does #region and #define
preprocessing - I'm thinking I'll put conditionally compiled code in a
different stream or somthing, but haven't read up on that enough yet. I've
also skipped unsafe code for now, but will get that in for sure..

If anyone has advice or spots uber slow/bonehead constructs, I'm not
sensitive. I'm new to antrl (and bent that way regardless), so I'm sure
there are plenty...

You can see it at:
http://www.richmediabuilder.com/beta/CSharp/csGrammar.html

or download the grammar and an exe (drag cs files into it, or use 'CSharp
filename.xx')
http://www.richmediabuilder.com/beta/CSharp/CSharp.zip

I'll try to tackle tree construction now, I'm probably going to model that
on the CodeDom where it fits, unless there is a better standard for
AST's...?

Wonderful tool btw. Kudos to all involved.

Cheers,
Robin

Sneaky.

Anyway, with this change ANTLR does in fact become a little faster:
about 7750 ms rather than 8300.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Antlr Design Patterns
Message-ID: <1077842880.403e93c0cd6ac@webmail.icehouse.net>

I'm just starting to use antlr and wanted some suggestions about how it should 
best be used, basically the suggested design patterns.  Most of the parser 
generators that I have used don't generate trees, so typically I would 
manually create the AST structure that I wanted in my actions, and then let 
everything else happen in/after the semantic analysis phase. 
 
So, I guess these are my questions: 
 
1) Antlr allows me to generate a tree structure and create custom nodes. Would 
I be better off just generating a standard parser (not a tree parser) and 
using the default node type or a custom node type? (Obviously, it will depend 
some on the complexity that I need.) 
 
2) Should I create a standard parser that generates some subset of the tree 
that I need and then create a tree parser to handle the AST the way I would 
like it. 
 
3) Any other suggestions on design/usage?  I presume any of the above 
possibilities are better than manually generating my own AST? 
 
Thanks for the help.

How about posting a link in ANTLR's grammar section or the actual

Hi Alex,

Well, I'm not sure that follows from that speed test, though I can 
easily understand your frustration.  There are many companies that use 
ANTLR for real work; just check the showcase. :)

Thanks for the valuable feedback.  You have my pledge to address 
efficiency in ANTLR 3.0 :)  Recall that ANTLR 2.x was built under 
duress while working at a startup.  Now I am a full time 
student-torturer and researcher :)

Best regards and thanks for at least looking at ANTLR.

Let me take a look at this.  Hmm...i don't see how that will match two 
A's.  It matches A, AB, B, EOF.  You're use of x: confusing me.  Is 
this a rule or a label as you have here?  Assuming it's a label.  Ok, 
let me rephrase your question to see if I understand:

start : (A (B)* | B)? ;

works but

start : (A (B)? | B)? ;

does not.  This is as designed.  In the loop case, I avoid a lookahead 
test for the exit branch each time by simply saying "while lookahead 
consistent with stuff inside; B in this case".  For the (B)? optional 
case, i test the lookahead for what follows the (B)? subrule which is 
EOF.

You cannot escape that EOF follows your start symbol, I'm afraid.  Can 
u explain why you don't want EOF to match?  Anything non-B should fail 
to enter the (B)? subrule, right?

Should start: (A(B)?|B|C|NEWLINE|EOF)
match an A that is followed in the token stream by something other 
than B or EOF?

(I'm assuming this rule is being invoked repeatedly by a driver so 
that token streams like AAAA or BCBCBC would get processed as a 
result of multiple invocations of start().)

Your assumption conflicts with how ANTLR sees things.  It assumes EOF will
come after any start rule, you are assuming that won't be the case.  

This behavior is more like searching than parsing.

Adding 
startLoop: (start)+;
Would satisfy lookahead requirements (look at generated code), however on
your second call  to start() will everything still be in sync?  I would
think so as long as you don't alter the stream in any way.

Of course I have to ask why not call startLoop() and have an action in there
to process every "start" unit of work?

Are you doing interactive parsing by any chance, like a command line
interface?  My approach here won't work for that.

Short version:

Please replace ANTLR-INTEREST@yahagroups.com with a _single mailing list_. Keep
things simple so that you (and we) can focus on improving ANTLR.

Long version:

Forums:  I hate web-based forums (the way Jive is normally used) so I hope that
you will replace yahoogroups with a mailing list. At the very least, allow us to
recieve messages in my email, allow us to post messages via email, and allow us
to reply to messages with our email programs' "reply" command.

Usually when people implement Jive they end up with a bunch of forums. I don't
see the value in that for ANTLR-INTEREST; I am not interested in every single
message that comes through currently, but I doubt you can divide up the messages
into forums that will allow me to say "I am interested in forums A, B, and D but
I'll never care about anything in forums C and E." So, please make it convenient
to receive _all_ the ANTLR messages by email.

IMO, the worst thing about Yahoo Groups is the search feature; it is frustrating
to use (especially, its paging is completely useless and its threading is bad).
If the search interface didn't suck too badly I wouldn't care about the ads. But
is Jive's search better than Yahoo Groups'?

Blogs: Usually, there is a one-to-one relationship between a blog and a person.
I doubt many people (even you, Terence) are going to have a blog that is
completely about ANTLR. Why would you want antlr.org to host blogs that aren't
ANTLR-specific? There are so many blogging hosts out there right now, what is
the advantage to our "ANTLR community" to adding another one at antlr.org?
Personally, I'd rather see a read-only ANTLR 3 source code repository (perforce,
subversion, or cvs).

Nice language, python....just a little kinky lexically. ;)

Lol.  Weird is all a matter of definition.

Hmm.  IIRC, the python grammar is very well defined, so shouldn't you just be 
able to take what's there and make it LL(k)? (hopefully without too much 
work?)

I'm actually working on a project for school that will handle the LR(1)->LL(1) 
conversion (where possible).  I'm using antlr as the tool and currently 
accepting a small subset of the antlr grammar.  I'm hoping to make it more of 
a general purpose grammar tool for analysis etc.

As far as the commas and Python, I presume you are talking about tuple 
packing/unpacking? Maybe on the print statement (indicating no newline)?

> I'll post something when it's ready for public consumption. :)

One of the reasons that I chose antlr is that I have heard that Python support 
is underway?  How is it coming?  Is there anything that I can do to help?  
I'll gladly test it out.  I tried out several different Python parsers 
(LR/LALR) for some work projects, but the debugging information they provided 
made them nearly useless so I ended up writing them by hand.  I recently ran 
across a few more, but was hoping I could wait for antlr to pick up Python 
support.

> Nice language, python....just a little kinky lexically. ;)

Oh yeah.  I still have to get used to the lexer parsing structure and how it 
stands apart from all the other ones that I have seen up to this point.  I 
suppose then that it wasn't the grammar that was giving you problems....

Thanks for the feedback and the tool.  I really like how I can look at LA(k) 
and FIRST(set).  They make it really easy to handle things that were 
previously much more difficult.

I've been much less than impressed  with the jguru message board, if that's 
what its officially called.  There's very little activity and, in general, 
most people don't seem to get many responses.  Jguru, however, does have a 
lot of nice faq information.

I would like to see a really active forum, but not as a replacement to a 
mailing list.  It's much easier for me to look through a folder in my inbox 
as I have time than it is to go out to a forum when I only have a minute or 
two.

Sometimes the breakdown of topics makes it harder to find things as well, 
depending on the size and activity of the board as well.

I suppose that doesn't really answer your question, but I guess it fits under 
my opinion ;)

Hello Terence!

> There are many companies that use
> ANTLR for real work; just check the showcase. :)

I know that, for example many companies use ANTLR java grammar to create its
commercial projects (RefactorIt, CodeWizard, etc.). But the question is how
these companies use ANTLR? As part of parser code generation, debug/research
grammar, or as code generator at start project (without using ANTLR for ocde
generation later) and than hand-fixing generated code on whole project
development trying speed-up it?

Turning back to rc-parsers (how I write it). On first stage write and debug
grammar using ANTLR (this is very simple and fast process). On second stage
write lexer (from the beginning), hand-overwrite parser and add tree
structures and debug it. In this "process" I use ANTLR (to save time), and I
may/must say that I use ANTLR. But end user that run program will not have
dealings with ANTLR generated code, because it absent in exe-file.

Finally. ANTLR is good, well-documented and useful tool. At the current time
main thing that it need is speed.

Two words about ANTLR3 DFA-like lexer. I hope it will be based on switch
statement (like re2c (for example re2c used in Wave Preprocessor)), because
table-driven lexers too big (when I try use PCCTS lexer for rc-files it
create is about 200K exe-file (of course I use table compression)).

Alex.

Subject: [antlr-interest] question about nondeterminism
Message-ID: <c1pthi+s8v2@eGroups.com>

I've got antlr 2.7.2.  Can anyone explain why the following grammar
gives nondeterminism warnings?  I would think that with enough
lookahead there should should be no ambiguity, but maybe I am
misunderstanding "nondeterminism".

Is this ignorable?

Without refactoring the rules is there some way (options?) to make the
warning go away?  (I know I could pull the ("A")? up into the test
rule before the foo|bar alternative but I'm trying to avoid that.)

below is the grammar:

////
class TestParser extends Parser;

options { k=2; }

test : foo | bar;

foo : ("A")? "X";
bar : ("A")? "Y";

Thank you!

I had been doing interactive parsing for debugging.  The grammar I'm 
working with is very irregular and context-sensitive so it is taking 
a lot of trial and error to determine the trade-offs between 
handling a situation in the lexer or in the parser.  The interactive 
parsing approach was working great for testing until I got to an (A)
(B)? parser rule.

The html.g Example, which has a lot of rules that end in a 
conditional, illustrate what you described.

My understanding had been that the lexer and parser worked 
identically except for the distinction between a character stream 
and a Tokenstream.  I see now that isn't the case.

Best wishes,
Susan J.

It's LL(1) 'cept for the optional commas and semis, which require k=2.

Stuff like that and

a=1; b=2;

and

foo(1,3,)

that's just wrong in my book, but I'm a language implementor not 
designer ;)

Well, a few people are playing around.  We have a python generator that 
works with jython, but nobody has translated the libraries to python 
yet.  I'm madly learning python as fast as I can ;)

Nope...grammar is autotranslated from distribution.  The lexer is 
totally nasty with context-sensitive whitespace etc...  For example, 
NEWLINE must be sent to the parser as it is statement separate etc..., 
but inside (...), [...], {...} whitespace indentation and newlines are 
totally ignored and not sent to the parser.

The issue is that there is the mailing list and the forum; people are 
rightly only interested in monitoring one area.

As I understand it, the minority use it as a "rough draft". The 
majority just incorporate it: IBM, WebLogic, etc...  The thing to keep 
in mind is that there are many apps that don't require blinding speed 
for parsing.  Ease of construction is more important.  That said, 
faster is always better ;)

Yes, it will be hand-coded like now except it will use small state 
machines to resolve infinite lookahead issues and it will left-factor 
automatically I believe :)

Hi.  I'm afraid this is the quintessential case where the approx LL(k) 
in this version of ANTLR falls down.  For example,

test:   "A" "X"
     |   "X"
     |   "A" "Y"
     |   "Y"
     ;

works, but is not probably easy to pull into one rule for your real 
grammar.

I'm apologize for the counter-intuitive grammar analysis algorithm.  I 
had to build it in a hurry years back and approx was easier than full 
LL(k) :(  Plus java was SO slow back then.

Ter
PS	ANTLR 3 will handle to full LL(k) and beyond into LL-regular

Yes, a single list is what I'm shooting for.  I'll even probably put 
something at the jguru forum that redirects to antlr.org's version 
when/if it appears.

There will always be an email gateway.  What don't you like about 
forums?  Now's the time to figure out what we want :)

Actually, I have been offered blogs on multiple sites but I just don't 
seem to want to tell people what I had for lunch or about the stupid 
person at the restaurant that annoyed me.  You'll note that my "blogs" 
at antlr.org are now text files where I dump my ideas for ANTLR 3 so I 
can organize my thoughts.  I generate copious notes...might as well 
post.

I can't imagine a blog for anything but ANTLR 3.

None.  I don't plan on allowing any blogs other than mine.  Perhaps if 
Monty wants one for somethign purely antlr related.

You shall have it, sir!  The thing is though that I'll not release it 
publicly until it's semi mature.  It's in my "playground" now and not 
yet in my formal code repository.  The code is too damn readable also 
;)  I'd hate for somebody to scoop me by building ANTLR 3 before I did 
;)

Hi Ross,

Well, Wiki inspired my TML format that I use for all of my course notes 
etc...  Same kinda thing, I just haven't set it up so you can alter a 
page like Wiki.  I think i like the comments attached better. Anybody 
that has write permission should really be altering my repository I 
suppose.

Thanks,
Terence

You have to log in to post (and sometimes to read, if you want proper "I've
already read this" tracking), and I prefer a "push" interface (email is sent to
me) to a "pull" interface (I check a website to see if somebody posted something
new).

Understandable. I was thinking to write a ANTLR code generator for a functional
language (ML or Nice) and so I wanted to see the "playground" so I can see what
sort of project it would be.

Howdy,

Loring and I have finished a first attempt at a python grammar. It 
seems to grok all of jython 2.1's Lib directory (40k lines of Python). 
The whitespace/comments/newlines/indentation thing is a nightmare to 
implement, but I think it's right. Very close to Python 2.3.3 
distribution grammar (minus the wackiness in the lexer).

http://www.antlr.org/grammar/1078018002577/python.tar.gz

I'm happy to receive and incorporate fixes.

Nice!  Thanks.

Ok. I ran it on about 50-100k of Python that a partner and I wrote on a 
commercial project.  The following is the only thing that cropped up:

- ------
$ cat test.py
#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# see http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0263.html
test = "Gabrielle Carr?"
print test
- ------
$ python test.py
Gabrielle Carr?

$ java Python test.py

        at Python.main(Python.java:44)

I also ran the following script in bash to look for some other things (after 
adding a System.out.println to print out the filename:

$ find /usr/lib/python2.3 -name "*.py" -print | xargs -n 1 -i java Python {} 
>> parsed_python.log 2>&1 >> parsed_python.log

It looks like it found lack of support for the same thing as above, complex 
numbers, and a couple other things.  I'll include the rest of it below (I'm 
not sure yahoogroups will let me attach) and I'll try to attach it as well.

Looks *really* good for a first try!

It is possible add to ANTLR3 operator priority? I read in some papers that
adding operator priority to yacc-based C++ grammars speed up whole parser
speed about 20%. And of course grammar with priorities more compact and
simpler.

yacc grammar with priorities looks like this:

%left "==" "*+" "/" "%=" "+=" "-=" ">>=" "<<=" "throw" "&=" "^=" "|="
%left "?"
%left "||"
%left "&&"
...

GeneralExpression :
    : lxmIntegerLiteral
    | lxmCharacterLiteral
    | lxmFloatingLiteral
    | lxmStringLiteral
...
    | GeneralExpression ".*" GeneralExpression
    | GeneralExpression "->*" GeneralExpression
    | GeneralExpression "*" GeneralExpression
    | GeneralExpression "/" GeneralExpression
    | GeneralExpression "%" GeneralExpression
...
    ;

Subject: [antlr-interest] Building for Debugging?
Message-ID: <c1t6dq+k52f@eGroups.com>

I attempted to turn on the debugging mode for my parser, got this
exception:

java.lang.RuntimeException: setDebugMode() only valid if parser built
for debugging

My grammar has the option analyzerDebug=true set in it, but i still
get this.  How can i fix this?

I've wondered about this.  We might be able to build a small precedence 
parser for expressions.  This has bothered me for 10 years and I would 
like to fix.

I was afraid of that encoding stuff.  Think I should just turn on  
unicode range for all chars and ignore the encoding?

I can perhaps look at the others later...they seem easy to fix (after  
the nightmare known as "lexing Python") :) ;)

Fixed that.  a typo.  Change line 508 in python.g to say COMPLEX  
instead of FLOAT :)

I think you need to turn on -traceParser and that will invoke the right

Subject: [antlr-interest] can somebody try the jython code generator?
Message-ID: <AEAA1C84-6AF7-11D8-97D0-000A95891192@cs.usfca.edu>

Howdy,

Amol (whose python code generator I posted a few months ago) claims to 
have a python generator that uses jython to handle the libraries, which 
would take awhile to translate.  Can anybody try it out?  I'm guessing 
you'd need to hook in the code generator by putting it in your path and 
then using option language="Python" or whatever the prefix is on the 
PythonCodeGenerator.java.  Then I guess you run jython on it with 
antlr.jar in your path.  Seems like that would work.

I don't know python yet more than a few lines and so getting it to work 
would be quite an effort for me.  Anybody wanna help?

Thanks,
Ter

I should be able to give it a try this week.  I have a grammar done for a 
python project that I was never able to use (ended up writing one by hand 
that I would like to replace) as the other parser generators for Python 
didn't work for my needs.

Hehe... That was my thought too, and I'm not even the one doing the parsing ;)  
I think that's perfectly acceptable.  As long as the encoding string gets 
picked up, you can let whoever is doing the semantic analysis deal with 
whether or not the encoding used matches the string.

Hehe.... I didn't even check to see if they were valid.  Although I would 
presume so as they are part of the base Python 2.3 install.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Getting at the token text in a parser
Message-ID: <c1u1e5+pq44@eGroups.com>

Here's what i have  - copied verbatim, because i'm not sure where the
error is.  I'm working w/ 2.7.2 in Eclipse (using the antlreclipse
plugin)

=== begin grammar segment ---
baseitem
:
(
	{ System.out.println("Entering address"); }
	ADR
	(
		params
	)?
	addressparts
	|
	{ System.out.println("Entering org"); }
	ORG
	(
		params
	)?
	orgparts
	|
	{ System.out.println("Entering N"); }
	N
	(
		params
	)?
	nameparts
	|
	{ System.out.println("Entering Agent"); }
	AGENT
	(
		params
	)?
	value
	|
	{ System.out.println("Entering " + $getText); }
	name
	(
		params
	)?
	value
)
ENDL
;
=== end grammar segment ===

It's the $getText above that is giving me troubles - i can't seem to
use it anywhere - i get the following runtime error if i try:

== error ==
java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problems: 
	text cannot be resolved
	_begin cannot be resolved
	text cannot be resolved
	_begin cannot be resolved
== end error ==

I get that error anywhere and any time i try to use $getText

I would just be using the debugging parser, but i can't get that to
work either - if i try to turn on analytic debugging in the parser
options, antlr borks on me with a fairly unhelpful silence.

I'm trying hard to get a grasp of this tool, because i can see that
it's very powerful, but i'm getting frustrated at the seeming
impossibility of doing basic things - and the lack of good
troubleshooting and/or common hitches.  The fact that the jguru forum
for it can't be searched unless you're a paying member isn't helping.

Hopefully someone here will be kind enough to walk me through what i'm
doing wrong.  I'll add in anything else that is necessary to diagnose
the problem.

Thanks again
Cheers

$getText works in the lexer, not in the parser--in the lexer, there is
text associated with a rule, but not in the parser..  What you want to
do is label the AST (or Token) nodes that you want to extract text
from--say
v:value { #v.getText(); }

(assuming Java, not C++).

Look at the examples directory in the distribution--your problem is
most likely that you need to mentally do a paradigm shift, and the
examples should give you a clue.

Halleleujah!

Thank you for the help.  Much, MUCH better now.

So, in a not-quite related note, since i'm asking anyway, here's an
interesting one:

The input for my parser may consist of "folded" text - basically, some
lines that are beyond a reasonable length will be wrapped with leading
whitespace indicating that their values are to be unfolded and treated
as all one piece.

So how do i look for that?  I was originally handling it by filtering
the input, but that was messing with my linefeeds and CRs, so i'd like
to handle it in the parser.  Essentially what i want is to return a
single token, call it VALUE, that takes everything from the first ":"
on a line to the first ENDL character that is not followed by some
whitespace.

Can this even be done?

This one's easy--note the use of "SKIP" for whitespace in the
examples.  Basically you want something like

ENDL :
      '\n'
      ( (' ' | '\t')+ { _ttype = SKIP; } | )
     ;

which looks for whitespace after a newline; if present, mark the token
as one to be skipped (you might need Token.SKIP instead of SKIP) so
that the parser does not see it.

ANTLR lexers can be extraordinarily capable--if you can write a lexer
by hand, you can write an ANTLR lexer for the same problem and much
more quickly.  The Python grammar that Ter just posted to the ANTLR
web site is a good example.

The only snag with this is, i don't want to get the token split there.

Basically, if i have the text

NAME:value part 1 is
     extended onto line 2

i want to see two tokens:
one with type NAME text "NAME"
and another with type VALUE text "value part 1 is extended onto line 2"

Is this possible?

The examples in "PythonTokenStream.java" are missing their indents.

ooops!  Did i do an "indent-region" in emacs and then have it format 
that comment?  Damn...

Yes, it is possible--it will require a syntactic predicate to skip
over the line continuation if you do the processing directly.  It
would be easier to do it as a token filter.

However, this looks like you are trying to do too much in the lexer (a
pretty common early mistake--part of the learning process is where to
divide processing passes).  Ask yourself why you want "value ... line
2" as a single token.  If you really want it as one string for post
processing, then you can re-consolidate it from multiple tokens in the
parser; that way, you can guarantee fixed spacing under your control.
  If you are going to do further processing on the contents, there is
a good chance you want to keep these as separate tokens in a syntax tree.

The reason i want it as a single piece is because there are so many
different forms of data that can come in that field

They run the gamut from semi-colon-separated lists of (~';')* to
base-64 or quoted-printable encoded text.  The latter are the ones
that give me serious fits, since i really don't know how to parse
those.  But i figure worst case, i get the whole thing in as one
element and use other parsing methods on it as needed.

The other kicker is, the type of encoding is specified by a token that
precedes that value, by some arbitrary (albeit bounded by the start of
the line) number of tokens.

Can you suggest the syntactic predicate and (i assume) text rewriting
that i would need to do this?  I'm at a bit of a dead end here.

Thanks for the help, and if someone *does* see a better solution than
the one i've got, please feel free to tell me!

Try something like

second
    :
    ( ('\n'! ( ' ' | '\t')+ )=> '\n'! ( ' ' | '\t' )+
    | ~'\n'
    )+
    ;

That matches everything to end of line, including continuation lines
but removing the newline on continuation lines ('\n'!).
