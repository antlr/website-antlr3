- SAC 2010

For the past twenty-four years, the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing  
(SAC)
has been a primary gathering forum for applied computer scientists,  
computer
engineers, software engineers, and application developers from around  
the world.
SAC 2010 is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Applied  
Computing (SIGAPP),
and is hosted by University of Applied Sciences, Western Switzerland  
(HES-SO) and
Ecole Polytechnique f&#233;d&#233;rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland.

- OOPS Track

The object-oriented (OO) paradigm is extensively used to
design and implement today's large scale software systems.
However, existing OO languages and platforms need to evolve
to better support features like interoperability, software
reuse, dynamic software adaptation, efficiency on multicore
hardware, security, and safety. The aim of OOPS is to foster
the development of extensions to existing OO languages and
platforms, as well as the design and implementation of new
languages and platforms embracing and enhancing the
object-oriented paradigm.
Particularly of interest for OOPS are papers that provide
a thorough analysis covering most of the following aspects:
theory, design, implementation, applicability, performance
evaluation, and comparison/integration with existing constructs and
mechanisms.

The specific topics of interest for the OOPS track include, but are
not limited to, the following:

   * Language design and implementation
   * Type systems, static analysis, formal methods
   * Integration with other paradigms
   * Aspects, components, and modularity
   * Reflection, meta-programming			
   * Databases and persistence			
   * Distributed, concurrent or parallel systems	
   * Interoperability, versioning and software adaptation

- Submission Instructions

Prospective papers should be submitted in pdf format using the eCMS (<A HREF="http://sac.cs.iupui.edu/sac2010">http://sac.cs.iupui.edu/sac2010</A> 
).

All papers should represent original and previously unpublished works  
that are currently not under review
in any conference or journal. Both basic and applied research papers  
are welcome.

Hardcopy and fax submissions will not be accepted. Submission of the  
same paper to multiple tracks is not allowed.
The author(s) name(s) and address(es) must not appear in the body of  
the paper, and self-reference should be in
the third person. This is to facilitate a blind review process. The  
format of the paper must adhere to the
sig-alternate style (available at <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2010/downloads10.htm">http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2010/downloads10.htm</A>) 
. The paper should not
exceed 8 pages according to the above style; please note that this is  
the same page limit as for the final version.
However, for camera-ready papers exceeding 5 pages each additional  
page will be charged 80 USD.

Papers that fail to comply with length limitations risk rejection. All  
papers must be submitted by September 08, 2009.
For more information please visit the SAC 2010 Website at <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2010">http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2010</A> 
.


- Proceedings and special issue

Accepted full papers will be published by ACM in the annual conference  
proceedings. Accepted poster papers
will be published as extended 2-page abstracts in the same proceedings.

Please note that full registration is required for papers and posters  
to be included in the conference proceedings
and CD. Student registration is only intended to encourage student  
attendance and does not cover inclusion of papers/posters
in the conference proceedings.

Finally, following the tradition of the past OOPS editions, after the  
conference some of the accepted papers will be selected
for publication in a journal special issue.
