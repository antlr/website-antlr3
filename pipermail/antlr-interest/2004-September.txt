SUBJECT: How to get back the coordinates from an AST? 

We use for the moment the last version of ANTLR (2.7.4). We 
have our particular grammar and all works fine. 

We have to analyse the AST produced by the parser to do an 
additional validation. When a problem is detected during 
this validation, we would like to hightlight the error in 
our editor. For that, we need to know the coordinates 
(line,column) using the AST we are analysing but the methods
getLine() and getColumn() always return 0 (we checked it in 
the ANTLR sources in the BaseAST class)!

For an example implementation:

There should also be FAQ entries on this on jguru (but it's down at the
moment).

Subject: [antlr-interest] Another StringTemplate Engine
In-Reply-To: <A828A814-FBA8-11D8-B3EA-000A95891192@cs.usfca.edu>
Message-ID: <200409011029739.SM00276@ANDREW>

Yes, it was mostly to make things easier. Originally I didn't have some of
those operators (equals, lt, gt), but with time I just added them.
That was one reason I found antlr StringTemplate hard to use. It's strict
separation of content and UI made it hard at times. I'm used to using CF
language, which is content/gui/logic all in one file. Not a good idea, but
gets things done really easily and fast.
I just added few constructs that I thought would be necessary. In some
instanced, you just need to put little bit of logic in your UI.
For example if you're displaying list of orders and want to flag those that
have total less than $100 in red. You could add a property to your business
object, but that's not always desirable, especially if you didn't author the
business object. But of course it could be argued the other way, that if
this requires some attention and if you deiced to change $100 to $200, it
would make more sense to have it in the object itself.
I've just know by experience (created 150,000 line cf back end system) that
sometimes you do need things like that in your UI for simplicity.

Hi Andrew,

Seems interesting.  I take it the enforcing separation philosophy was 
not a prime consideration for your derivative because of the equals 
operation you allow etc...?

Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLR workshop (Oct. 7-8)
Message-ID: <ch56j1+qvv0@eGroups.com>


We still have only a few people officially signed up for the workshop.
 I suspect that that is because of the uncertain times and lack of
advertising.

The previous workshops have been a blast.  They have been heavily
focused on practitioner experiences interleaved with theory and
discussions on the future of ANTLR.  Ter can be expected to present
some of his fabulous tutorials--he is an outstanding speaker, and the
presentations are always entertaining.  Significant parts of ANTLR 2
grew out of ideas presented at the last (1997) workshop.

Anyway, if you think that you have something to say or just want to
rub elbows with fellow practioners, the workshop is a good place to be.

Please let Ter know if you plan to attend or cannot because of the
date--he needs information to make decisions soon.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Another StringTemplate Engine
References: <200409011029739.SM00276@ANDREW>
Message-ID: <000401c49060$3c9ba530$0400a8c0@NOTEBOOK>

I have also created a template engine based in StringTemplates
WebStringTemplate (www.webstringtemplates.com)
It differs from StringTemplates in that it defines a formal
data interface definition file (HTML) which allows the web page design and
the server programming to be completely separated and comes with
extensive documentation.
It also includes the concept of object filters on the server side modify
how the strings are produced by the server for supply to the
data interface.

I kept to the strict separation and aimed at keeping the web side of
 the template engine as simple as possible (there are already too
many languages out there to learn)

To over come the $100 red problem you mentioned and other
formatting issues,  I recommed web page designers using my engine
use javascript to do any UI type formatting.  The server provides the
data strings (as specified by the data interface definition file) and the
web page displays it as it wants.

matthew
P.S. V2 is under development which improves the visabliity of
templates and lets you develope the web pages using just
your favourate HTML editor, the data definition file
and a webpage containing the processing applet.

There's a version updated for 2.7.1 at

http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr/

I'm only providing the download. It might work with current releases or it
might not. For the rest I have no clue about it. Since this version nobody
has submitted any patches and the original author has not been responding
to mails.

Cheers,

Ric

hi friends,

i am having the following .bms file 

CHCM001  DFHMDI MAPATTS=(COLOR,PS,HILIGHT,VALIDN)

and it the only line which i have in the file. and can any one help 
me in modifying my grammar file in such a way that i can process 
above one. I have taken care in my grammar file but still giving me 
error with

line 1:50: unexpected token: ["",<1>,line=1,col=50]

You need to add the EOF token to the end of either the "main" or "file"
parser rules, I think.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Problem with keeping information in Custom AST nodes
Message-ID: <ch9her+ou2l@eGroups.com>

Hello,

I am trying to code a chain lexer/parser/walker1/walker2
 implementing
a chain of tree transformations. My treewalkers build custom AST nodes
called MyAST. 

My expectation was that the extra attributes encoded in my custom
nodes when executing walker1 would still be there when executing walker2. 

In fact, the instruction astFactory->create(_t) generated by Antlr
does not, in my case, initialize these extra attributes, only Type and
Text are initialized correctly. 

I have subclassed the AST, not the ASTFactory, maybe that is the pb?

Can someone point me to an example so that I can try and find what I
did wrong ?

Thanks
Francis

Subject: [antlr-interest] Re: Get AST info of a previos treeparser
In-Reply-To: <ch0ffm+mh34@eGroups.com>
Message-ID: <ch9jlo+9kfb@eGroups.com>

I have the exact same pb (and I have just posted it before seeing this
post) so let me elaborate a little : 

In TreeParser1, I build a tree t containing a custom node NODE with
attribute attr.
Now in TreeParser 2 parsing t, I match NODE with rule 
rule_treeparser2 : #(NODE other_rule)
{ cout << #rule_treeparser2->attr ;}
;

If buildAST = true, antlr generates a copy of the original node but
attr is not initialised. The call made to astFactory->create does not
initialize the extra attributes, only Type and Text.

If BuildAST = false, attr is there but as the original message says,
that is not what we want.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Range generation in C++ mode
Message-ID: <1094226087.9875.29.camel@perseus>

Hello,
I have a beginners question about range generation in C++ mode. When
trying to track down the problem I have I came to this simple grammar:

==== snip ====
options {
	language="Cpp";
}

class SimpleParser extends Parser;
options {
	buildAST = true;
}

expr:
	(ID)+
	;

class SimpleLexer extends Lexer;

WS:
	( ' '
	| '\t'
	| '\n' { newline(); }
	| '\r'
	)+
	{ $setType(ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr)Token::SKIP); }
	;

ID:
	(LETTER)+
	;

protected LETTER:
	('\u0000'..'\u00f3')
	;
==== snap ====

I have a simple main file just reading an input file and starting the
Lexer/Parser. It's mainly a direct ripoff from the calc example.

If I run my executable I see the following:
==== snip ====
martin@perseus simple $ ./Main input.txt
Using file input.txt
Hello World out there
Parse exception: <cin>:1:1: expecting token in range: '0x00'..'0x63',
found ''H''
==== snap ====

Somewhere with the Lexer I found this line:
        matchRange('\0','\363');
which I just don't understand. Is this a bug or am I doing something
wrong? I'm writing this on a Linux system with ANTLR 2.7.3 and
gcc-3.3.4.

Regards,
Martin Probst

Message-ID: <1931D896-FEA4-11D8-A595-000A95891192@cs.usfca.edu>


Howdy folks,

I have a smart grad student adding search to the antlr site as a small 
"directed study" project.  It will be a basic spider type deal that 
sniffs the site at some regular interval.  Not sure how to incorporate 
the search from jGuru's FAQ, but I'll figure out something.  The search 
*might* differentiate between types such as "grammar" vs "article" if 
it's easy.  Should be.

The only unsolved problem is the mail archive thing.  I have mail going 
back many many years (even when the mailing list was run at UMN before 
the web became popular).  The formats are all very close to UNIX mbox 
format I'm pretty sure.  There are a few questions:

1. do you really want to get answers for ANTLR that are out of date?  
So, how far back in time should I put up on the net?  Should I put it 
all up and then add a "date" field to the search?

2. Should we just import into gmane?  Doesn't this just propagate the 
problem that someday that site will go away and I'll have to find 
another solution?  Seems like I should find a simple means of 
displaying the email messages at antlr.org and then add the mail to the 
search db.  I certainly like being in absolute control of my destiny 
and data ;)

3. Email addresses are all over the archives, which is a drag to 
expose, but you'll note that your addresses are all already exposed on 
the yahoogroups web pages.  So, i'm not sure this a "problem".

Anybody have answers/comments/suggestions?

I'm slowly starting to catch up with the world after the first week of 
class.

I just updated http://www.stringtemplate.org to have my slides from the

Message-ID: <chdmqr+n9ts@eGroups.com>

Hi All,
The ant documentation (1.6.2) seems to be out of date for the ANTLR task.
It says that to get the task to work, I need to MAKE the antlr-all.jar.
The problem is that there does not seem to be such a target in the
2.7.4  source distribution.

What to do?

Possibly an option to order the result by dates (like search in google groups).
This days I have been using Lucene ( a jakarta apache java library to
index and search documents). I haven't used it a lot but it's very
nice and easy. And I think that you can modify the score function to
put more score on newer messages using a date field when you index
documents.

Well, possibly a solution using lucene or your student aplication is
better than gname.
Or posibly not, I don't know how gname works.

For me is a very, very big problem. Expose emails is a lot of SPAM.
And Yahoo don't expose the emails if you are not logged and subscribed
to the list.
For example your mail is displayed <parrt@c...> when I am not logged.
I think that before putting the mailbox in some documentation archive
a little Perl script have to do some regexp work in the emails.

And I want to say, that the mailing list archive, will be very useful
for the newbies to antlr like me.

If the archive goes back to the 2.7.0 era I guess it should be sufficient.
Sort by date should not be hard to make.

Gmane is a very quick way to get results. I already tried a bit around with
their search and it's vastly superior to the yahoogroups excuse for a
search. Also their email obscuring stuff seems to work ok. If you got a
mbox format thing lying about then I could not think of a reason to not
have it imported there. (while maybe working on a proprietary solution)

There's quite a number of packages for displaying mail archives (Mhonarc
for one) so it should not be hard I guess. Add a generic small site spider
like htDig (www.htdig.org) to the mix and you got something I'd be happy
with for one ;)

You could just mangle them all with a script before importing them
somewhere.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Antlr and accentuated characters
Message-ID: <413C95E9.5070100@free.fr>

I have a problem running antlr on a grammar file that contains 
accentuated letters such as (?).  How can I indicate such a character 
using its "code"?

Right now, I use the . for such characters in my accentuated keyword but 
I also have problems parsing files that contains such characters. My 
char vocabulary is:
    charVocabulary='\3'..'\377';
Is it sufficient?

Thanks.

Hi. The issue is that ANTLR itself only accepts 7bit ascii (not sure 
why i've not fixed this yet).  The charVocab thing only works for what 
antlr generates not antlr grammars themselves...sorry about that.  Try 
changing antlr.g's charVocab and rerunning antlr on itself then 
recompile and see if it fixes things. :)

It sounds vaguely familiar. Is this using MSVC? What does the assertion
say? It could be some locale related setting that may send isprint
somewhere down a wrong path (if this comes from isprint)? A backtrace of
the crash could also help.

I also got a hack that has better UTF8 support in C++. Using a modified

Yes, it happens when compiling with MSVC 7.1 (2003). I've attached the
stack backtrace. The precise message is:
> Debug Assertion Failed!
> Program: ...
> File: isctype.c
> Line: 56

It's really called from isprint as you can see from the backtrace.

I'm actually quite content with the way I handle it at the moment. The
only problem I will get is proper error reporting (with respect to column
numbers) but I'll either do this in a special error handler or with an
ugly client-side hack. Converting UTF-8 to UCS-2 or sth similar would not
actually help me as I have to compare the string values of tokens to UTF-8
strings later on.

Martin

Hi,
I managed to test antlr-2.7.4 today, it works now, thank you very much.
On other terms I now have a problem with my grammar under windows. I'm
trying to parse UTF-8 from C++ by just ignoring the multi-byte nature of
UTF-8 chars (e.g. I have special letter tokens composed of multiple
single chars).
If I compile & run the code on windows I get an exception that a debug
assertion has failed in isctype.c (?) if I put UTF-8 chars into my input
file. Is this a known bug or problem?

Could you verify that in the file String.cpp (line 41) of your support
library the character fed to isprint is anded with 0xff ? I'm kindoff
surprised that a negative value gets to isprint. It might be that you still
link to an older support library ?

Well the actual result of the 'hack' would be that you still have UTF8 at
the parser/treeparser level. (in all getText calls and similar) And have
correct line/column information because the lexer internally uses 32 bit
values.

Message-ID: <chk6oe+2iam@eGroups.com>


Hi Listeners

I need to have some of the generated Lexer members (those that 
recognize token) as virtual so I can overide the lexeme depending on 
external contextual values.

Is there a way to do so with ANTLR??

Subject: [antlr-interest] ANTLR274: Small functional extension proposal: synonym
Message-ID: <chk7bi+rg3k@eGroups.com>

Hi Terence & all

I would like to propose you the following extension to manage simply 
synonyms. One could define in the tokens section definition some 
lexemes that abstract themself to a same token like :

tokens {
	 YES = "YES" | "Y" | "OK" | "YEAP" | "DA";
}

Since all literals above should returns the same YES token value, 
IMHO, it should be enough to generate in the Lexer something like:

void Lexer::initLiterals()
{
	literals["YES"] = 3;
	literals["Y"]= 3;
	literals["OK"] = 3;
	literals["YEAP"] 3;
	literals["DA"] = 3;
}


In fact, this will avoid to have a grammar rule that specifies all 
the alternatives to get a YES which is really the case!!


What do you think about??

Cheers

FA

Subject: [antlr-interest] Multiplexing question - no lexer token to switch, context necessary
Message-ID: <!~!UENERkVCMDkAAQACAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgAAAAAAAAA135T7T6kikqzRJj4mD52bcKAAAAQAAAAnA+4CS9EmECJYM4I1aeS5AEAAAAA@fmi.uni-passau.de>

Hi everybody!

I am stuck with a multiplexing problem. I understand that in general it is
no good idea to switch the lexer from the parser.

However I have the problem that I would need a different lexer dependent on
the context. There is *no* token (like e.g. "/**" for JavaDoc) to allow
switching the lexer from within the lexer. Only the parser knows about this
necessary context.

The problem is that - depending on context - foo*bar should be parsed as
IDENT STAR IDENT or as WILDCARD_IDENT, but, again, there is no single token
to indicate this state change, only the context (i.e. the current parser
rule the parser sits in).

I am not sure if this is still context-free, is this even possible with
ANTLR?
If yes, could anyone please give me a hint how to handle this?

Thanks for any suggestions!

Best regards,
	Max

That's correct, it's not anded with 0xFF:

Since when should the change be in the files? I've got String.cpp from the
antlr-2.7.4 distribution (no doubt there, the version number is within the
CVS $Id$ tag).

Well, at the moment it works for me (tm). And in general it should even be
a tiny bit faster if I'm not mistaken... Is that 'hack' publicly available
somewhere? I would like to test it out ... the XQuery/XML specs use UCS-2
so it would be quite handy to have an UCS-2 aware parser generator that is
transparent to later UTF-8 string handling.

Subject: [antlr-interest] New development snapshot
Message-ID: <20040907135402.GC15481@cs.utwente.nl>

Hi,

I released a new development snapshot with quite a load of fixes/changes
etc. One of the biggest upcoming changes is the use of the
www.wheatfarm.org reference counter (this snapshot only uses them for
tokens so far) A big thanks to Mark Lentczner for donating these.

Get it at:

http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr/

Here's a summary of the changes:

* Changed reference counter for tokens to www.wheatfarm.orgones. A big
  thanks to Mark Lentczner for donating these. This fixes also problems
  with using custom token types.
* Added TokenStreamRewriteEngine C++ port + example.
* Fixes for sign extension problems that sneaked in 2.7.4.
* Fixes for some quoting bugs in C++ codegeneration.
* Fixes for some wrong extensions in generated docbook and HTML files (for
  -html/-docbook commandline options).
* Tweaks for preliminary UTF8 support. Includes an example that is capable
  of parsing UTF8 input (more proof of concept than what is to be). (Using
  a custom InputBuffer and CharScanner). Feedback on this is appreciated.
* Fixed codegeneration bug ('a'..'z'!) would trigger generation of invalid
  C++ code.
* Added missing warning for redefinition of AST types for nodes. (Thanks to
  Sergey Bogdanov)
* Bugfix for AST factory initialization code.
* Fixed default argument mangling for generated rule methods.
* Fixed sign extension problem in error messages in support lib
  (triggered by MSVC)
* Fixed type generated for saveIndex and _begin variables. Thanks to Brad
  Schick for the patch.
* getFilename/Line/Column methods added to
  TokenStreamRecognitionException (thanks to Heinz Beckers)
* Added lexer states to the flex lexer example. It now seems to parse the
  same set of java as the other antlr java parsers.
* Added --without-java option to configure.
* gcj build now coexists better with java build.
* Added makefile for csharp action parser. It now will get rebuild with the
  rest of antlr.
* Small tweaks to include files.
* Docu tweaks.
* Build tweaks.

Cheers,

Ric

Ack. It's a fix from after 2.7.4 release then. Look for the new snapshot
announcement.

Also look for the snapshot announcement it's the unicode example you should
be looking at (it's pretty rough more proof of concept)

I'm a bit unclear to which methods you're referring. If you want to
override individual rules by overriding their methods then you may have a
problem since rules in general cannot be lifted out of their context. (the
first/follow sets need to be the same)

So do it with a parser rule--
wildcard_ident: IDENT STAR IDENT;

You probably don't like that because then you could recognize foo * bar 
as well, assuming you are skipping whitespace like most parsers.

Alternatively see if you can use a filter.  Read my article 
http://www.codetransform.com/filterexample.html.  I really have to edit 
it to be more to the point, but the gist is to have a filter that is 
actually a parser and can start parsing a particular rule if it can, 
otherwise pass the token through.  So you would not skip whitespace in 
the lexer, instead you would have a filter to do that.  The filter 
would also have the rule that required WILDCARD_IDENT so as to change 
IDENT STAR IDENT to WILDCARD_IDENT.

You may also be able to have enough context introduced into your lexer 
to recognize it.  But without any more specifics it is hard to help.

Hi,
I spent some time looking for a way to solve this but I failed. I'll 
appreciate some advice.

I want to parse lines of text. The lines include all kinds of words, 
numbers, expressions etc.

I need to distinguish the lines according the first letter of the 
first word. This letter determines the format of the rest of the 
line. Identifying the first character will allow to use the correct 
set of tokens.

The problem is that these first letters that identify the line 
format, can appear any place else in the lines. My standard word 
token includes these characters as well. This causes ambiguities and 
parsing errors.

Example:
Mline p1 p2 p3 p4 a=12 g=34 sdf sdf
Rline p1 p2 asd=23 sdf 
Yline p1 p2 
etc.

How do you suggest I approach this problem?

Hi Monty,

Thanks for your hints.

A parser rule won't do the job unfortunately  - never seen so many
nondeterminism warnings, I think the output was longer than the grammar then
;) And you are right - whitespaces are discarded (which might be a reason
for the nondeterminism warnings). But I am not sure if I want to have WS
tokens in the parser.

So I'll try the filter aproach you suggested below.

Thanks again, regards
	Max

I'm eager to collect more examples of using a parser filter.  Let me 
know if I can help you get this technique to work.  If you would be so 
kind as to share the filter code you come up with I'll annotate it and 
post it on my website.  I'll probably discuss it at the upcoming ANTLR 
workshop too.  What is your language?

Thanks,

Hi there..

I would do this by multiplexing several lexers. One main lexer that
reads in the first char and then switches to the appropriate sub-lexer
(on for each line format) who spits out tokens for that line and pops
itself of the stack when it sees end-of-line, so that the main lexer
picks up from there.

Ant's optional ANTLR task was not written and is not
supported by ANTLR (Terence).  I believe the contents
of ANTLR's various jars have changed so you may not
actually need antlr-all.jar .  You should only need
whatever jar it takes to run antlr.Tool .  Anyway, you
won't find an Ant target to build this jar because
ANTLR doesn't have an Ant build file, due to the fact
that Ant violates Ter's principles regarding XML for
human consumption.  In fairness, since he's such a
great guy he did once say that he would include an Ant
build file if someone else would write it (I'll take a
look, Ter).  Basically you just want to DL ANTLR and
use its included build scripts/batch files to build
the jar you need.  First I would try the bundled
antlr.jar though--you might get lucky.

Hi.  Well, that's pretty specialized.  Further, all you have to do is 
add them to the hashtable of literals with the same token type and 
it'll just work. :)

Yes, it is what I have done for now

But the problem is the maintenance and the lisibility of a grammar
maintained by a third party. IMHO, it would better to express the fact that
a token has more than one lexeme or textual representaiton in the grammar
itself than in a additional derivative generated lexer. (Just for you to get
my point, my grammar has more than 260 tokens with at least 20 synonyms)

Make the evidence evident whenever possible is a quite good rule when
programming!

Regards

FA

PS:  JavaCC is providing such synonym descriptions in the grammar

Of course, for now, you can do that manually.

Didn't dlg support this sort of thing via token sets?  I'm with Ter on
this one, BTW--this sort of aliasing can be done in the parser
(including setting the token type, if that is desirable) easily and
with minor effort in the lexer (check the ID tokens to see if they
match any in the list and setting the token type if they do--that is
expensive, but no more so than for an automated mechanism).  The
parser approach is the more efficient, so why support it in the lexer?

I agree with this opinion although I have never faced a case where
synonimes are required. Synonimes is part of the language so it should
be expressed in antlr instead of doing it via action code.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0409081950260.5989-100000@g4.pauljlucas.org>


	I want to be able to construct parse trees and not ASTs.  For
	example, if I have:

		letExpr
		    : LET varRef ASSIGN expr ;

		varRef
		    : DOLLAR IDENT ;

		expr
		    : /* yadda, yadda */ ;

	I want a tree like:

		letExpr
		   |
		   +-- LET -- varRef -- ASSIGN ------ expr
		                |                      |
			        +-- DOLLAR -- IDENT    +-- ...

	That is: letExpr has LET, varRef, ASSIGN, and expr as children;
	varRef is the root of a subtree that has DOLLAR and IDENT as
	children; and so on.

	Another example:

		factor
		    : expr STAR^ expr ;

	I want the tree:

		factor
		  |
		  +-- expr -- STAR -- expr
		       |               |
		       +-- ...         +-- ...

	and not the one that ANTLR would create for an AST where STAR is
	the root of the subtree.

	Is there a way to get what I want?

Subject: [antlr-interest] Expected token apparently not expected?!
Message-ID: <chq6ft+hvc5@eGroups.com>

Hi folks,

I have a simple lexer which defines:

 DASH
  : '-'
  ;

And a simple parser which uses the DASH token.

But I'm getting an exception that says:

Exception in thread "main" line 1:12: expecting DASH, found '-'
        at antlr.Parser.match(Parser.java:213)

Which is way too tricky for me!  Any clue
what might be going wrong?

thanks,
David.

Sounds like a mismatch between the token type (an int) between the 
parser / lexer.  Check importVocab if in separate files...

It seems this might be it.  

Having now deleted the .txt files as part of my build, I have
unearthed a problem - lexer.g imports literals exported from parser.g,
and parser.g of course imports lexer.g.  What is the 'right' strategy
for compiling these?

I have parser and lexer in different files, since I want my resulting
classes in (Java) packages, and it seems that the header{} block in a
.g file can only appear once, and only applies to the class definition
it immediately preceeds :-(

thanks,
David.

Just for clarity, I have something like:

... in p.g

class P extends Parser;
options {
  exportVocab = P;
  importVocab = L;
}
rule
   : "keyword" DASH "modifier"
   ;


... in l.g

options {
  exportVocab = L;
  importVocab = P;
}

DASH
   : '-'
   ;


... and I am attempting to use antlr.Tool to compile them, and it
whinges at me if I give >1 grammar file to compile.

thanks,
David.

Always use import/export vocab in a clear chain. E.g. have definitions move
up:

Lexer -> Parser -> treeparser

e.g:

In l.g do exportVocab = L;
In p.g do importVocab = L; and exportVocab = P;

In subsequent tree parsers importVocab = P. If you do treetransforms that
add new AST nodes you have to add more import/exportVocab's.

Once you have such a chain set up make sure you always built parsers in the
right order e.g. first the lexer then the parser then the treeparser.

antlr.Tool only accepts one grammar to parse. So you have to run it
separately for different .g files.

Note that when you have lexer/parser in one file then the semantics of
exportVocab/importVocab are slightly different. All the lexers/parsers in
one file share the same vocabulary so usually you don't have to use
import/exportVocab.

Hi Paul,

Strange.  Perhaps my spamblock got stuck in your spamblocker ;)  Be 
advised that my email challenges all unknown emails to prove they are 
human (just once and just once for all users of knowspam.net).  For 
some reason, yahoo.com mail does not play well with the system so many 
of them go in the bitbucket :(  Anyway, it prevents me from getting 
1500 spam a day.

Can you retry?  I don't see it in the "customs holding" area of my 
challenge-response system.

Hi Ric,

Thanks for your reply (which got me a solution in the end!).

I guess the problem is that if you use literals in the parser, then 
the lexer needs to get these somehow.  This means that the grammar 
needs to be 'pushed back' to the lexer.

> In l.g do exportVocab = L;
> In p.g do importVocab = L; and exportVocab = P;

Instead I did:
 
  p.g   exportVocab = L;
  l.g   importVocab = P;

and compiled p.g first.

This seems counter-intutitive to me (and not to your taste either, I 
gather), but it makes my paser behave how I want it to.

IMHO it would be better to dispense with importing and exporting 
vocabularies, and have antlr.Tool accept multiple grammar files on 
the command-line, to achieve similar results as the 'all classes 
defined in one grammar file' semantics.

thanks!
David

You can try this dash is nothing but the UNICODE so simply

Oh yeah that's a good point. I usually define all tokens in the lexer using
the tokens section. So the parser can be a clean 'consumer' of the vocab of
the lexer.

e.g. in the lexer:

class L extends Lexer;
options { .. }
tokens {
  IF="if";
  ELSE="else";
  ..
  LBRACE="{";
  RBRACE="}";  
  ..
  PLUS="+";
  MINUS="-";
  .. etc. ..
} 

If you do it like this you can use the texts as well as the token in the
parser:

if_else: IF expr LBRACE expr RBRACE ELSE LBRACE expr RBRACE;
or:
if_else: "if" expr "{" cmds "}" "else" "{" cmds "}";

I personally like the last way of writing things down, but that's a matter
of taste ;)

I agree with you that the current import/exportVocab stuff is not exactly
pretty, we should take care to do better in ANTLR 3 (I think it was already
on the hate list). Although it offers some flexibility too. E.g. you can
make the tokenTypes.txt files yourself and only use imports. Currently it's
also easy to make mistakes due to typos in tokens (they get silently
added).

Cheers,

Ric

Hi Mark!

You might want to take a look at how I solved that problem for boo[1]
which also happens to use syntactically significant whitespace.

The trick lies in using a token stream filter[2] to transform whitespace
tokens in virtual INDENT/DEDENT tokens (antlr rules!).

If you need more details just let me know.

Cheers,
Rodrigo

Howdy...you can look at the python grammar I did...should be in the 
grammar section of the site. :)

Sure, you can build something with ANTLR to do that.  A good starting 
place would be my C grammar, see the link below.  You would have to 
change the lexer to pass the comment into the parser and from there, in 
an action, send the contents of the comment to another lexer/parser to 
grab what you need.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Problem with ANTLR 2.7.4
Message-ID: <ci4shj+344d@eGroups.com>

I am trying to parse x86 assembly text, but the problem I am having is
not related to this task.

I have the following rule in the grammar:

assemblerStatement
    :   a:asId
        (   b:expression
            (   COMMA! c:expression
                (   COMMA! d:expression
                )?
            )?
        )?
    ;

This works just fine, it parses things and builds an AST.

Now, I want to build an AST node for the assemblerStatement rule
containing different number of children, based on how many expressions
are matched. So I modified the rule as follows:

assemblerStatement
    :   a:asId
        {
            #assemblerStatement = #( #[ASSEMBLER_STATEMENT], a );
        }
        (   b:expression
            {
                #assemblerStatement = #( #[ASSEMBLER_STATEMENT], a, b
);
            }
            (   COMMA! c:expression
                    {
                        #assemblerStatement = #(
#[ASSEMBLER_STATEMENT], a, b, c );
                    }
                (   COMMA! d:expression
                    {
                        #assemblerStatement = #(
#[ASSEMBLER_STATEMENT], a, b, c, d );
                    }
                )?
            )?
        )?
    ;

Unfortunately, the parser no longer terminates (it does not crash, it
just hangs). I could debug it if necessary, but I wonder whether the
problem is with my grammar.

Any help is much appreciated.

Thanks,

Mihai

Hi.  You can only use

> #assemblerStatement = #( #[ASSEMBLER_STATEMENT], a );

type statements at the end of an alternative as you will mess up the 
automatic AST construction algorithm.

In your case, you can simply put "!" on the rule definition to turn it 
off :)

Message-ID: <ci5toh+47h8@eGroups.com>

In Lexer.java the input string is tokenized based on the tokens 
defined under this.

I want to tokenize giving my own delimiter.

eg:
I have two tokens, say name and age defined in lexer.
And also have one more token alphanumeric.

Now, if my input string is

 name=raj age123=21

I need to tokenize this by giving delimiter as blankspace and '=' and 
generate four tokens 'name', 'raj', 'age123' and '21'.

Instead, since name, age and alphanumeric are the tokens defined, my 
lexer is generating token as follows,

    1.    'name'
    2.    '=raj'
    3.    'age'
    4.    '123=21'
which i dont require.

IS THERE ANY WAY WHERE I CAN SPECIFY IN LEXER TO TOKENIZE ACCORDINGLY?

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

You only have to define the tokens well and the lexer will do the good job.
Your problem is in your lexer rules. If  you want post them.

Subject: [antlr-interest] First release of ASPA
Message-ID: <4146F0EF.9090103@yahoo.gr>

Hello everyone.

I'd like to announce the first release of ASPA, the project I was working on the last year.
ASPA is a source to source compiler which translates ASP into PHP code. The goal
of ASPA is that the translated code provides the same functionality as the ASP
version of the initial source.

Beside using ASPA for translation of ASP pages, some parts of it could be useful
or interesting to other developers.
Components:
Lexer for plain text (html.g)
....... JavaScript. This is a modified version of the Java lexer distributed with antlr
........VBScript
Parsers for JavaScript and VBScript as well as TreeParsers for those languages.
Since ASPA is licensed under GPL you are free to use any of those components.

An other aspect which could be interesting for an antlr developer could be the
usage of XML for some parts of the translation and also for testing. Regarding the
usage of XML in the translation process I've written a small paper which I'd like
to send to the forthcoming antlr workshop.

Also, in order to separate the grammar from the action code, I have used
a tool called annotation (you can find a slightly modified version of the tool in
the file sharing section of antlr.org named anottation2).

ASPA can be downloaded from
http://storm.cs.unipi.gr/~anakreon/aspa.html

Anakreon.

Hi Mark,

it's a binary that only works with cygwin. I'm sorry if this wasn't
clear from the start. Maybe Terrence should add a comment about that.
I have also noticed that it is quite picky about the particular
version of cygwin that's installed. My suggestion would be to compile
it from the source, following the instructions that I provided in a
separate article.

Tom

Thanks for the response.  I didn't really want to install cygwin or the JRE
though.  I'm going to be using ANTLR in a mass distribution to an
environment where C# is the only available tool.

I found JET, which produces a real standalone.  As a fringe benefit it is
supposed to be faster also, although I didn't test it for speed.  I went to
the trouble of producing a standalone using their trial version and I made
it available to the mailing list here.  It is not legal for any organization
to use though.

JET is really expensive.  I left a message for the JET people asking for a
free version that leaves the advertising blurb in the installer.  I think
they should go for it since it will give a lot of free advertising.

I was hoping that one of the thousand subscribers to this mailing list would
already have a JET license and offer to make a JET installer for ANTLR, but
no one has bit yet.

It just occurred to me, is there a way to wrap a cygwin binary into a
transparent .exe installer like JET does with their Java interpreter?  That
would accomplish the same goal.  My real requirement is just to be able to
install ANTLR with a single click.

You can just drop the right cygwin dll next to it without installing
everything I think. Another option is use mingw to compile antlr, that
should work. (Use --enable-gcj when configuring)

Cheers,

There is also precompiled .net (J#) executable for antlr:
http://www.antlr.org/share/1057505418267/antlr_net-2.7.2_bin.zip
You need .net framework installed, but since you're using C# then it should
work. You just need to install J# libs (which is free distrib from
Microsoft)

Make that --with-gcj btw. I just tested it it builds out of the box on a
recent mingw install with gcc 3.4.1 (except for one glitch but it gets to
building an antlr.bin (should make that an .exe actually two glitches that
is). I'll drop the binary tomorrow morning on my webpage.

Hi, 

I'm newbie in this area. Problem I'm trying to solving is 
something like this. 

I have a large C, C++ code base. Is it possible to use antlr
to generate function dependencies from this code base? 
Basically I want to parse each funtion definition, and 
identify what functions are referenced by this and store 
this information into a file.

"warning message nondeterminism". I want to suppress this warning 
messae throught the process.

"I don't want to see this warning message". Is there any other option 
present for that.. I have tried to use "warnWhenFollowAmbig option"

I don't know how and where to use this option.

Code which I have

The J# libs aren't installed with .NET?  Then that is just as bad as 
installing Cygin or the JRE in terms of not being standalone.  

If the J# libs are redistributable, not too big, and I can install 
them with the antlr executable then that would be great.  That would 
make the most logical sense since everything else is .Net.  I'll 
check into it.

Thanks.

So this binary should be standalone?  I'll check it out.  Thanks.

SUBJECT: Command Line Switch parsing 

I am new to ANTLR. I would like to parse and reformat data

I'd like to start with an existing grammar that was written

Hi,
have you looked at the GNU getopts package? It's largely used for
exactly that - and I'm pretty sure it's available for a lot of
languages.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Lookahead problems
Message-ID: <53883.194.39.131.39.1095334157.14431.squirrel@server02.webmailer.hosteurope.de>


Hello,
I have a lookahead problem with my grammar. I have a parser which has k=1
but it actually seems to be looking ahead further than it should. See this
output of ANTLR with -traceParser -traceLexer:

In the state before these steps my parser has recognized a "dirAttribute".
It looks ahead, finds a "=" and a '"' and then descends into a
dirAttributeValue. That's expected and good.

=== snip ===
> dirAttributeValue; LA(1)== > lexer mNEXT; c==104
  > lexer mQUOT_ATTR_CONTENT; c==104
  < lexer mQUOT_ATTR_CONTENT; c==123
 < lexer mNEXT; c==123
"
 > lexer mNEXT; c==123
  > lexer mLCURLY; c==123
  < lexer mLCURLY; c==32
 < lexer mNEXT; c==32
 > quotAttrValueContent; LA(1)==http://www.w3

   < lexer mQUOT; c==46
   > lexer mQUOT; c==34
   < lexer mQUOT; c==32

 < lexer mNEXT; c==32
{

  < lexer mRCURLY; c==32

[ ca. 15 grammatical steps removed ]
    > literal; LA(1)==.org
     > stringLiteral; LA(1)==.org
     < stringLiteral; LA(1)== > lexer mNEXT; c==32
  > lexer mWS; c==32

 > lexer mNEXT; c==47
  > lexer mSLASH; c==47
  < lexer mSLASH; c==49
 < lexer mNEXT; c==49
}
    < literal; LA(1)==}

=== snap ===

Now the rule for "attrCommonContent" states:
attrCommonContent:
  /* some more alts */
  | LCURLY expr RCURLY
The lookeahed of the RCURLY should by that be sufficient to exit the
attrCommonContent rule. So why does the parser require more lookahead from
the lexer when exiting stringLiteral?

The problem with that is that within dirAttributeValue the lexer has to
throw tokens in a different manner than within the following expr rules.
This means I have to switch the lexer to a different state (done with
actions within {} in the grammar). I can't switch the state before the
parser leaves the attrCommonContent section (that means, the statement has
to be directly behind the RCURLY within that one). But at that point the
parser has obviously already fetched more tokens behind the RCURLY which
leads to errors.

My lexer has k=2 and the whole stuff uses C++ with the runtime and
generator from antlr-2.7.4. Can anyone help me with this? Am I
missunderstanding ANTLRs behaviour in general or is this a bug or what?

Thanks,
Martin

Also, I'm trying to compile the new ANTLR snapshot from Ric Klarens
website with MSVCC 7.1 (MSVS.NET 2003) in hope it might help things. There
seems to be a problem with the use of std::for_each and std::upper_bound
in TokenStreamRewriteEngine.cpp. Can someone confirm this?

I cannot confirm it, but I'm always interested to hear what's going wrong.
Just noticed I forgot to uglify the TokenStreamRewriteEngine.cpp with
ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE macro's. Maybe that's a source of problems (although
MSVC7 should support namespaces I think...)

Cheers,

Ric

Yes, it should. And according to MSDN documentation it should support the
use of those algorithms in the very same way you use them. I have to admit
that I have no idea what's going on.

Subject: [antlr-interest] rpms for antlr
Message-ID: <414AA92C.4090104@free.fr>

I build rpms for installing antlr easily on all our machines. You can 
find them at:
http://artis.imag.fr/Membres/Xavier.Decoret/resources/antlr/index.html#rpms

Building the rpm I found a minor problem with antlr-2.7.4.tar.gz. when 
doing make install, you get antlr.jar installed in 
/usr/share/antlr-2.7.3 so I guess the version number was not changed.

I also have some questions for Terence Parr.
- is that OK if I distribute the rpms?
- for the license, I put "Terence Parr" for the moment. I understood 
that ANTLR is free but can I say it is GLP?
- is there any special reason you are not using libtool for building 
libantlr.a for C++?

Finally, I don't know a thing about csharp, so I haven't included a rpm 
for it as I do not know what to build, what to install for it. If 
anybody has this information, I could use it!

Great! Is this based on the included spec file ? If not I'd appreciate
patches to the included spec file.

Did you base this on java or on gcj ? How did you solve the problem with

Yeah that one slipped through :( I can provide a 'service pack' patch on
2.7.4 that fixes a load of issues found after release.

Well I'm not Terence but anyway ;) GPL (at least I assume you mean GPL) is
quite different from public domain. Which is the current license for antlr.
So better stick public domain in the RPM header (at least I assume you talk
about the license tag for the RPM header?).

Redistribution should be ok it's public domain after all, only if it's
somehow modified then you should better mark it as such in a readme or the
RPM header. You can also upload the RPM's to antlr.org. Or put a link on
antlr.org to your site (that's what I do with my antlr snapshots, that's
more convenient than hassling with the upload file thing)

Actually it could be cool if Terence made a yum repository for antlr on
antlr.org (it's only a certain directory structure on a ftp/webserver) That
way we could automatically push out updates.

I didn't use libtool because it doesn't add anything when building a static
archive. It only adds delays in the build (ok not a big issue anymore since
I got my new machine ;) )

Cheers,

Ric

I solved it the dictatorial way ;-). I made it depend from j2sdk which 
is a freely available rpm.

All right, I'll slip public domain for the license tag (currently I put 
"Terence Parr").

That would be great. Actually, I made a rpm for that reason: it is now 
on our internal yum server.

It does add a lot! But it is subtle. I am building a static library A 
with libtool. It links with libantlr.a.  Then I am building a shared 
library B that links with A. If I build libantlr.a with libtool, then 
this process works and I can distribute the libB.so. But if I use the 
libantlr.a build by Terence package, libtool refuse to build libB.so (I 
am not sure why).

So I would like a default built with libtool ;-)

But it is not that important...

Ack, my coffee level must be low ;) I assumed you had made changes to the
included spec file or rolled your own (seeing your license question, since
the included one lists 'Public Domain' as license).

All those changes are already in the repository only question is when a
2.7.5 release will be made.

That's weird behaviour you describe. Could it be that the libtool build of
library B strips out the libantlr, or mangles the order of the archives
passed to the linker?

Libtool has an annoying habit of knowing things better when it in fact does
not (e.g. it sometimes strips out necessary options) This is actually the
main reason why I hate it with a vengeance. (I maintain the Gnu compiler
chain on solaris here on the faculty and it seriously annoys the crap out
of me that I have to rerun every link command manually for every library
that uses libtool just because it insists mangling the options I want to
see on the linker command line)

> So I would like a default built with libtool ;-)

I'm somewhat afraid that I need more convincing ;) I could consider making
a fake libantlr.la file though...

Cheers,

Ric

Message-ID: <1095419005.18738.36.camel@perseus>

Hi,
I've done some work to track this down and it seems to be a bug in the
C++ runtime. I have created a very simple sample grammar and run it
through ANTLR one time as language="Cpp" and once as language="Java".
The result is that in java mode everything works fine and the parser is
LL(1). In C++ mode somehow two tokens are read from the lexer in
advance. 
See this trace, first, Java is alright:
=== snip ===
martin@perseus Parser $ echo {{{foo}}} | java -classpath
/usr/share/antlr/lib/antlr.jar:. TestMain
 > expr;  > lexer mLCURLY; c=={
 < lexer mLCURLY; c=={
LA(1)=={
  > enclosedExpr; LA(1)=={
   > expr;  > lexer mLCURLY; c=={
[...]
=== snap ===
Then C++:
=== snip ===
martin@perseus Parser $ echo {{{foo}}} | ./TestMain
 > expr; LA(1)== > lexer mLCURLY; c==123
 < lexer mLCURLY; c==123
 > lexer mLCURLY; c==123
 < lexer mLCURLY; c==123
{
  > enclosedExpr; LA(1)=={
   > expr; LA(1)== > lexer mLCURLY; c==123
 < lexer mLCURLY; c==102
{
=== snap ===
You can see that it's reading one more token than it should. This should
usually be no problem but when you want to (read: have to) change the
state of the lexer within special grammar rules things get broken
because the next token is already recognised in a wrong way. This way I
can't use ANTLR :-/

I'm attaching the grammar, a TestMain.java and a TestMain.cpp source.
Everything should be really straightforward.

Hello,

I recently had the task to generate syntax errors in a foreign
language (german) in a ANTLR parser. Since the default error handling
is ok, I do not wanted to write an exception handler for every rule by
myself, I decided to change the default output only. Also I don't
wanted to change the C++ runtime library. Then my Odyssey began. To
override reportError() was easy. But a RecognitionException has not
all information necessary in the base class. So we have to distinguish
MismatchedTokenException and NoViableAltException via RTTI. Some data
like MismatchedTokenException::tokenName is not accessible, but can be
modified to use LLkParser::tokenNames of the generated parser. Also
the definitions of (TOKEN, NOT_TOKEN..etc) are only available in the
MismatchedTokenException class and had to be put manually in the code.

My code is working now, but it is not simple to understand why it had
to be written in that way and it is error prone to the slightest
change in the runtime library.
My question is, did I miss something? Or is there no easier way to
change the output of the default error handler? Perhaps the overall
scheme should be changed to ease such a task.

Best Regards,

Peter Sprenger

Thanks for the bug report and the example files. I'll have a look at it (no

Doesn't it work to add multiple overloaded reportErrors for
MismatchedToken../NoViable.. to the generated lexer/parser/treeparser?

The current scheme is not ideal. Also for multilanguage and
internationalization support the current setup is not sufficient. I guess
that a setup where the exceptions do not generate the message themselves
would be better.

Maybe dump all eror reporting into a single object that's shared between
all the lexers/parser/treeparsers in use, and delegate to it from
reportError and friends. I think Ross Bencina posted ways back a proposal
for improved error handling, I only never got to working on it. Basically
if you can cook up a sane proposal and implementation we're all ears :)

Cheers,

Ric

I'll try to take a look into it myself too because I can't continue to
work on my grammar without a fix for the problem. This is a really
annoying bug to me.
Let me know if I can be of any help.

I tried this, but somehow only the original reportErrors function was
called. Perhaps because all exception handler catch a
RecognitionException, their call to reportErrors is only of this type,
too.

I am under pressure in my current project, but afterwards I will try
to find a solution.

Hi Ric,
the attached file is a patch against your antlr-20040907 snapshot. I
think I've found the problem in TokenBuffer::fill() (see the patch).
The problem was (as far as I understand it) a wrong condition in the
loop that appends tokens to the queue ("<=" vs "<"). This made the C++
TokenBuffer always consume one more token than desired, it was always
one token ahead of the lookahead.
I'm not 100% sure this doesn't break other things but at least in the
corresponding .java file the while loop has the same condition as in my
patched version.
I hope this will work for others too, at least it fixes my problems.

Martin

Hi,

I know Ric doesn't approve building antlr with libtool, so I've put together 
my own hack. Appended are Makefile.am and Configure.ac. Throw them in lib/cpp 
and run libtoolize, aclocal, automake, autoconf, configure and make in the 
right order ;-). The files were done for the most recent snapshot by Ric. For 
2.7.4 you'll need to remove Countable.hpp/.cpp from Makefile.am.
Have fun,

Hi :)

Sure!  How about posting to the file sharing section of antlr.org?

What is GLP?  It's definitely not GPL, if that's what ya meant.  ;)  
It's essentially public domain.

Do you guys know of any resources (discussion lists, software) that

this not supported by ANTLR?

What is fundamental restriction that prevents ANTLR to parse

Thanks for assistance,

Subject: [antlr-interest] Parsing Trees and FSM question
Message-ID: <cifpi1+7h5d@eGroups.com>

Hi,

I am new to the parsers and ANTLR but I wish to pose a question 
concering directed (with directed edges) tree parsing.

My program produces trees where each node of a tree can assume 
nominal values from a finite set i.e. X={a,b,c,d}, Y={A,D,E,F}. I 
would like to know how from an adjacency matrix (matrix where there 
is 1 in row X and collumn Y only if there is a directed edge from X 
to Y i.e. X->Y) representation and knowledge about the values that 
each of the variables can assume I could generate lexer and parser. 
The structure of the tree is unknown in advance (i.e. depth) but it 
can restrict those trees to binary trees, but I ideally I would 
prefer not to do so.

In addition to this information I have a probability distribution of 
these variables P(X=a,Y=e).

How could I generate such a tree recognizer?

In addition I am wondering how I could easily generate FSM(Finite 
State Machine) using ANTLR. Are there any tools for FSM generation

Thanks for assistance,
Walter

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0409171627140.8087-100000@g4.pauljlucas.org>

	If I have, say, an XML parser in ANTLR and I want to, say,
	construct an AST for an XML element attribute list, what's
	considered "best practice" for it?

	Specifically, given:

		<foo bar="1" baz="2">Hello</foo>

	Method 1 generated AST:

		ELEMENT
		    QNAME "foo"
		    ATTRIBUTE_LIST
		        ATTRIBUTE
			    QNAME "bar"
			    VALUE 1
		        ATTRIBUTE
			    QNAME "baz"
			    VALUE 2
		    CONTENT "Hello"

	Method 2 generated AST:

		ELEMENT
		    QNAME "foo"
		    ATTRIBUTE
		        QNAME "bar"
		        VALUE 1
		    ATTRIBUTE
		        QNAME "baz"

Subject: [antlr-interest] Compiling multiple files
Message-ID: <d2d18a10409181042770f16dd@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

If I compile multiple files I have to create multiple instances of the Lexer?
Because the API have a constructor without setting the input buffer,
but I can't see any method to change the InputBuffer  and use the same
lexer instance.

Cheers,

IME, it's almost always better to have the list.  By pushing down the
variability (i.e., elements may have a variable number of attributes) one
level, everything at the element level is fixed.  That makes it easy, fast,
and reliable to get any of the fields -- e.g., the element's content would
be the third child.

Hope this helps,
		John

Hola,

Tengo una apliaci?n de consola que entre otras plataformas trabaja con Windows.
El problema es que cuando envio mensajes supongo que se envian con
UTF8 y la consola tipica de windows (cmd.exe) diria que no lo soporta.

Mi pregunta es, alguien sabe si se puede configurar la consola para
que accepte UTF8 o alguna manera de cambiar el encoding para que
cadenas con accentos o car?cteres similares se vean bien?

Subject: [antlr-interest] Problem with LT
Message-ID: <414E9726.3090102@free.fr>


I cannot find (I kow I saw it, but the search function is broken on the 
website) the documentation on LT()

In my parser, I have a rule like this:

i:id EQUAL value { if (notExist(i) cout<<"Error on line 
"<<LT(0)->getLine(); }

where EQUAL is a lexer token.

It creates segfault from times to times. I am not sure why I used LT(0). 
I think I believed (at the time I wrote this grammar) that LT(0) 
indicates the first token of the grammar rule.

Is that correct? Should I use LT(1) to refer to the EQUAL instead? Is it 
simply a bad practice to try to get a line number for a parser rule?

Thanks for explanations.

Here is a translation from my daughter.  (this is not a regular service)

Hello,

I have a console application that, along with other
platforms, works with Windows.

The problem is when I send messages I suppose that
they are sent with UTF8 and the typical console of
windows (cmd.exe) which doesn't support it.
My question is, does anyone know if one can configure
the console to accept UTF8 or some way of changing the
coding so that characters with accents or other
similar characters can be seen?

Not 100% sure if this is in the 2.7.4 release but all lexers should have a
setLine/Column method with which you can change the line position of the
inputBuffer (see the CharScanner.hpp for what happens) (if it's not in
2.7.4 copy over the relevant bits from the latests snapshot or use the
latter)

Cheers,

Ric

I just tried switching to the "Lucinda console" font and it supports more
UTF-8 characters than the traditional "Raster fonts". I couldn't get it to
produce the characters using 'Alt' key combinations, but I could copy and
paste them from Character Map okay. 

Most of the old raster fonts (such as Terminal, MS Serif, etc) only seem to
support 255 ASCII characters.

So try switching to another font (selecting "for all future windows") and
then printing your characters from your console application as Unicode and
see if it makes any difference.

I know that in the past, when I wrote a Cantonese language practise
application, I ended up using GDI's TextOut() and a suitable TrueType font
to display the accented characters, but I didn't try switching that console
font at that time from memory, so I think its worth a shot.

It?s a tree structure as such, but 'right' refers to the list of siblings
and 'down' refers to the list of children below this node. I believe the
implementation is probably a linked list of some sort. 

The structure of the Abstract Syntax Tree is defined by the '^' and '!'
characters in the parser rules and the '#' rules in the parser tree.

^ = This is the root of this rule (with left-most precedence I believe); all
other tokens become children.

! = Do not add this element to the tree (i.e. good for non-required text
tokens such as "INTO" in "INSERT INTO table ...").

#(x y z) = Defines a tree parser rule. The first token in the list
afterwards is the root token (i.e. 'x'). Subsequent tokens are the children
tokens. 

So by adjusting the parser and tree parser rules you can change the
behaviour of the tree construction. From what you have said, it sounds like
the SQL grammar does not have an AST, so you will need to modify the rules
to create the tree that is most suitable to you.

The following structure is probably going to work the easiest...

"select"       ->    "from"       ->      "where"
   v                    v
0+ columns           0+ tables

Hi.  Please use this list for StringTemplate too.  It will eventually 
be absorbed (partially?) by ANTLR. :)

Message-ID: <d2d18a104092100504e984cd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I read the CodeGeneration article of Terr and I thought that I can use
for my pseudocode language compiler because I have to generate Java
code also for didactic purposes.

But I have some problems using it  from an AST generated by ANTLR.
Well, in fact, I haven't started to do it yet. But I made a simple
test code simulating it.

For example I have:

#/(DECCONST name:IDENT type:IDENT)   

And to test it I have done this simple template string (I have tried a
lot of variants, but none have worked):

group Java;

algorisme()::= <<
public class Algorisme {

   public static Main(String argv[]) {
       <decconst>
   }

}
>>

decconst()::= <<
   <t:{final <tipus> <nom> <if(valor)> = <valor> <endif>}>;
>>


And I write this test program simulating that I'm parsing the AST and
I have the name and type of the constant declaration.


public class TestStringTemplate  {
 public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{

   StringTemplateGroup plantilles = new StringTemplateGroup(new
FileReader("java.stg"),
AngleBracketTemplateLexer.class);

   StringTemplate algorisme= plantilles.getInstanceOf("algorisme");
   StringTemplate decconst= plantilles.getInstanceOf("decconst");

   for(int i=0;i<5;i++) {
     decconst.setAttribute("t.{nom,tipus}" , "nom"+i,"tipu"+i);
   }

   System.out.println(decconst.toString());

   algorisme.setAttribute("decconst",decconst.toString());

 }
}


I know (or better, I think) that I can do it creating a bean. But it's
not a little unproductive to have to create a bean for everything from
the AST?
My question is what is the better way to use StringTemplate to
generate code from a ANTLR AST?
And I can use it without having to generate a bean for everithing?

My code is a Catalan pseudocode language similar to Java then I have
things like (previously translated to English):

(#IF expr THEN block ELSE block)
(#FOR expr TO expr DO block)
...

A lot of thanks in advance,

Thanks for the patch I'll investigate. I know this <= appeared for a
reason, there was a case where things could go into an infinite loop,
something using a tokenfilter, I'll try and dig up the exact reason and
figure out how to fix things without breaking.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Problem with error handling.
Message-ID: <cipj3g+jqaj@eGroups.com>


I'm trying to write a lexer/parser that will read in a command line 
with switch options.

Something like:
cmdx -sw1 cbn kjy -sw2 mm -sw3 

In the lexer, I identify the switches (starting with hyphens) as 
tokens:
  SW_1, SW_2, SW_3
and the commands are identified as tokens too:
  CMD1, CMD2, ...
and I identify the non-switches as a parameter PARAM.

In the parser, I do something like:

protected sw1_switch   : SW_1 PARAM PARAM;
protected sw2_switch   : SW_2 PARAM; 

mycmd : CMD1 sw1_switch sw2_switch EOL;

Basically this is working, but I have problems with
validation.  Some entries can get confused.
For instance, if I make a mistake and type:

cmd1 -sw1 aaa -sw2

Switch sw1 is only supposed to take two parameters.
An error is thrown (good), but the code generated by
ANTLR to recover looks like:

protected final void sw1_switch() throws RecognitionException, 
TokenStreamException {		
    try {     
        match(SW_U);
	match(PARAM);
	match(PARAM);
	}
    catch (RecognitionException ex) {
        reportError(ex);
	consume();
	consumeUntil(_tokenSet_3);
    }
}

The problem is that _tokenSet_3 refers to the -sw2 switch.
The first consume() clears the -sw2 token and then the consumeUntil()
is looking for a -sw2 token.
The consumeUntil() reads past the EOL token and into the next line of 
input.
I want the command to exit with an error and clear all tokens through 
the EOL token.
I don't want to modify code autogenerated by ANTLR.

Is my parser definition bad?  
Is there something I can do to overcome this problem?

If it is posible you can define a more general token that matches the
four tokens. And do the check at semantic level.

Remember that you can use semantic predicates in the parser.

Hi.  Restriction on number can be encoded in syntax but as you point 
out combinations are combinatorial in size ;)

I suggest simply using the first XXX rule and then an action at the end 
that asks if everything is covered exactly once.  Perhaps a bitset 
updated in each alt and then simply checked at the end.

The distinction between syntax and semantics is very often blurred. :)

Subject: [antlr-interest] infinite loop in tree
Message-ID: <cipl88+ueo2@eGroups.com>

Hey everyone,
I have a situation where the following string may arise

blah CLIPPED 

I want to represent this in an AST as:

LS_CLIPPED
   |
   blah

so I have the following in my grammer

factor
  : v:variable (l:leftSidedOperators[#v] { #factor=#l; })?
  ;

leftSidedOperators[AST operator]
  : CLIPPED {#leftSidedOperators = #(#[LS_CLIPPED,"LS_CLIPPED"],
#operator);}
  ;

However when the AST is generated I get a StackOverflowError and as
infinite representation of the Tree like
LS_CLIPPED->blah->LS_CLIPPED->blah->LS_CLIPPED etc.

Can anyone help me with this.
Thanks in advance,
Mark

It seems you need more than a bitset, unless you add semantic predicates to
each alternative...

	// alternative one - bits.  errors come from syntactic predicates.
	XXX :
		( { TT(1) == 0 }? TokenType1 { setTT(1); }
		| { TT(2) == 0 }? TokenType2 { setTT(2); }
		| { TT(3) == 0 }? TokenType3 { setTT(3); }
		| { TT(4) == 0 }? TokenType4 { setTT(4); }
		)+
		{ ... here check for existence of each ... ; }
		;

	// alternative two - ints.  perhaps better error message.
	XXX :
		( TokenType1 { incrTT(1); }
		| TokenType2 { incrTT(2); }
		| TokenType3 { incrTT(3); }
		| TokenType4 { incrTT(4); }
		)+
		{ ... here check for exactly one of each ... ; }
		;

What features of Java v1.5 do you think would be helpful to you?  Do you
have problem with the existing Antlr generated Java code that would somehow
be solved by generating Java v1.5 specific code?

Thanks,

Subject: [antlr-interest] C++ as a target - FAQ questions...
Message-ID: <ODEDLGHNIFGKLNIHIHLLEEHOCOAA.ewbank@synopsys.com>

Hi Folks,

I've just started to use ANTLR, and seem to be in the minority because I
have C++ as my target language, rather than java.  I've been able to compile
an executable with my language it in (hurrah!), but am having a hard time
sorting out what is Java and what is ANTLR in a specific file.

Is there a place where someone that knows compilers well (theory and
application) can find information on what is available in the actions and
surrounding code for a C++ target?   The LL(k) versus LALR stuff wasn't much
of a problem - though lexing REAL versus INTEGER is annoying - but figuring
out the class hierarchy and what magic incantation to use to get what I want
seems to be hard.

For example, I know that C++ uses "->" in most(?) places where the Java uses
"."; likewise, "::" instead of "." seemed to resolve some other problems.
Now I'm at one that stumped me.  In the "Debugging and Testing Grammars"
discussion on the web, there are several calls to "super.<xxyyzz>"; however,
I don't know the name of the superclass to use when translating this to C++,
so can't precisely implement this on my own.


Thank you,

The "->" appears for all the reference counted stuff.
- Tokens  (RefToken)
- AST nodes (RefAST)
- LexerSharedInputState
- ParserSharedInputState

For all places where the dots appear for namespace qualification the C++
parts use "::".

In general all the action code is pure C++. Though the filtering that is
done on the code inside the action code to translate the tree
building/referencing is somewhat crude at times (lacking in error feedback,
but that's a general antlr problem)

You also can generate documentation of the support library with doxygen.

In case of doubt it really helps to look at the generated code. But that's
a general idiom for antlr.

You mean you're trying to port the ParseTreeDebugParser stuff from java to
C++ ? If you get it working I'd welcome the files then I can include them
in the C++ support library.

To get to the question if I look at for instance ParseTreeDebugParser:

Some of the constructors would be ported to:

public:
ParseTreeDebugParser( int k ) 
: LLkParser(k)
{
}
public:
ParseTreeDebugParser( TokenBuffer& tokenBuf, int k ) 
: LLkParser(tokenBuf,k)
{
}
public:
ParseTreeDebugParser( TokenStream& lexer, int k )
: LLkParser(lexer,k)
{
}

It's basically chaining the constructors to the superclass.

Add the necessary ugly ANTLR_USE_NAMESPACE(antlr) macro's for the antlr
classes btw.

The super.match( .. ) things would translate to LLkParser::match( .. ) 

Cheers,

Ric

Yeah, you should turn off automatic tree building for factor:

factor!:
....

In fact you should do that for leftSidedOperators as well.  In general 
if you are constructing trees with actions you want to turn off the 
automatic tree construction.  This is a common reason for having an 
infinite loop in a tree.

## is a shorthand for the root node of a rule.  Another shorthand is 
#ruleName.  That should do it.

Thanks Monty,
I can't believe it was that straight forward. My functions were
actually larger than what I had posted (for clarity!) so I turned off
automatic tree building at the else parts and it worked a treat.

I tried the ##->getText() earlier and when I build a c++ output I get
a couple of errors.

error C2065: 'printRoot_AST' : undeclared identifier
error C2065: 'currentAST' : undeclared identifier
error C2228: left of '.root' must have class/struct/union type
error C2227: left of '->getText' must point to class/struct/union

Those errors lead me to believe that using ## was inappropriate for
this problem. What needs to change to be able to use ## for future
reference.

The #[rulename]->getText() works like a champ though.

Thank you,
Chris

Howdy,

Just a reminder and a call for participation for new folks to the 2004 
ANTLR workshop.

Sounds like a bug.  Do you have a reproducible test case?

Oh, I don't care if ANTLR generates 1.5, but I want to use 1.5 in the
actions of the productions.

Well its reproducible but I have not isolated a small stand alone
application the exibits its.
I assume they will fix it in the final release.

Try and see if there's a comment describing it in the java code.

LT(0) would refer to the token that has just now been read. E.g. it's not
doing what you want probably.

Just tag the token:

i:id eq:EQUAL value { if (notExist(i) cout<<"Error on line" << eq->getLine(); }

Hi Terence and all.

I am using ANTLR for a C++ generated parser. My development 
enviroment is Eclipse 3.0 with the plugin of Torsten Juergeleit. 

IMHO, putting ANTLR on CVS would be helpfull for delivery of fixes, 
new advanced versions (those of Ric for example) and so on..

Did you already plan to put ANTLR on CVS and if so when??

I thought the antlreclipse plugin (http://antlreclipse.sf.net) would
only work with Eclipse 2.1?
Is that available somewhere?

I must be missing something... What's stopping you from using v1.5 features
in actions right now?

It's been in a Peforce SCM repository (rather than the POS that is CVS) for
a long time.

At this point, if you have changes/fixes, send them to Ter (or Ric for the
C++ specific stuff).

Take care,

There is a perforce repository for ANTLR instead of CVS.  Anyone 
serious about committing fixes can get a login, just ask Ter.  
Alternatively send complete changed files to Ter, that is preferred 
over patch files.

Subject: [antlr-interest] antlr bug or grammar problem?
Message-ID: <civ3i5+80h4@eGroups.com>

I'm using antlr 2.7.4. 
I've run the grammar building both a cpp and java version with same
results.

You can see the grammar file here
http://www.synergyss.com/SCRExpression.g.
and the java output here
http://www.synergyss.com/SCRExpressionParser.java

The issue is showing up in the parser code generated for rule
eventExpr on line 279.
The line: 
  ( BECAME_TRUE | BECAME_FALSE | CHANGED ) => expr {printf("processing
simple event expr\n");}

is showing up as this in the generated parser.

<<<< begin code snip
		switch ( LA(1)) {
		case BOOLEAN:
		case DoubleDoubleConst:
		case FloatDoubleConst:
		case LongDoubleConst:
		case IntBinaryConst:
		case IntHexConst:
		case LongHexConst:
		case UnsignedHexConst:
		case IntOctalConst:
		case LongOctalConst:
		case UnsignedOctalConst:
		case IntIntConst:
		case LongIntConst:
		case UnsignedIntConst:
		case LPAREN:
		case PLUS:
		case MINUS:
		case LNOT:
		case BNOT:
		case BECAME_TRUE:
		case BECAME_FALSE:
		case CHANGED:
		case ID:
		{
			expr();
			astFactory.addASTChild(currentAST, returnAST);
			if ( inputState.guessing==0 ) {
				printf("processing simple event expr\n");
			}
			eventExpr_AST = (AST)currentAST.root;
			break;
		}
<<<< end code snip

What is strange is that if I change line 281 from:
  ( BECAME_TRUE | BECAME_FALSE | CHANGED ) => expr {printf("processing
simple event expr\n");}

to:

  ( BECAME_TRUE | BECAME_FALSE | CHANGED ) => simpleEventExpr
{printf("processing simple event expr\n");}

the code generated is correct.

<<<< begin code snip
		switch ( LA(1)) {
		case BECAME_TRUE:
		case BECAME_FALSE:
		case CHANGED:
		{
			simpleEventExpr();
			astFactory.addASTChild(currentAST, returnAST);
			if ( inputState.guessing==0 ) {
				printf("processing simple event expr\n");
			}
			eventExpr_AST = (AST)currentAST.root;
			break;
		}
<<<< end code snip

Any ideas on how to solve this problem?

Thanks for the help.
Chris

Subject: [antlr-interest] StringTemplate2
Message-ID: <d2d18a10409231114634ebfdb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Some days ago I made a question but nobody has answered it. Possibly
because it was too much long and complex. Because it's a lot important
for me I reformulate it again  in a more  simpler way.

I have a template: vardef(type,name)::= << <type> <name>; >>
And code like:
   vardef.setAttribute("type","int");
   vardef.setAttribute("name","i");
   vardef.setAttribute("type","char");
   vardef.setAttribute("name","c");

I understand that my template doesn't work as expected
int i;char c;
And I understand the why. But after reading all the stringtemplate
docs twice I don't find any way to do it without using beans. It is
posible to do it without beans?

I don't want to use beans because, I find it unproductive, because I
have to create a lot of beans from the AST.

A lot of thanks in advance, and excuse me for posting the same
question again. But I think that possible with this simpler question
will be more easy that someone be able to answer me.


Cheers,

Sorry...had it up in a window, but didn't have time to answer...

Hmm...you need to use the separator="\n" which would require that you 
apply vardef to a bean.  instead, just do this:

vardef(type,name)::= <<
<type> <name>;
 >>

newline before >> is the key. :)

A syntactic predicate doesn't work by modifying the lookahead, it 
actually tests the grammar fragment in 'guessing' mode and then if that 
is ok it will proceed.  I don't think you've found a bug in ANTLR.  
However, you were looking at the code for a reason.  What's the 
original bug?

Skipped over your question, sorry. 

The problem I'm seeing is that the expr rule is being run when the
line parsed starts with an ID token.

I expect the expr rule to only run when the line parsed starts with
the BECAME_TRUE, BECAME_FALSE or CHANGED tokens.
 
Thanks,
Chris

Hey, I used to work on that grammar!  Anyhow, this may be a bug in 
ANTLR.  Syntactic predicates are used to disambiguate.  Here, ANTLR 
sees no ambiguities between the alternatives, so it doesn't use the 
syntactic predicate.  If it were generating a syn pred you would see 
guessing mode incremented and the decremented at the end of the 
predicate.

Try a semantic predicate instead 
{LA(1)==BECAME_TRUE||LA(1)==BECAME_FALSE||LA(1)==CHANGED}?

haha, Small world. 
I wrote the code to generate the test vectors for you back then. We've
been working together for a while and didn't know it. :>)

I tried the semantic predicate and it worked just like I expected.

Terence would this be considered a bug or works as designed?

Thanks so much.
Chris

I'm searching the docs and archives right now, but maybe someone can
tell me quick... is there an option for disabling the generation of
_tokenNames?

I'm blowing the 64K limit on the static initializer for the generated
class file (Java) for my tree parser.

(1100 keywords... $#@! Progress 4gl)

I don't think there is such an option.  You might have to post-process 
your generated files or tweak the code generator.

There's a binary of the latest snapshot on my page at:

http://www.cs.utwente.nl/~klaren/antlr/

That one is created using mingw and does not require cygwin installations.
The other that floats around in the filesharing section requires a
cygwin.dll if I'm not mistaken.

The snapshot binary should work for normal 2.7.4 operation I think.

Message-ID: <1095975731.9542.44.camel@perseus>

Hi,
I want to wrap my generated parser / lexer into a namespace. I've found
the option 'namespace="xxx";' for C++ but this doesn't really work as
expected.
When I just write that into my options block nothing compiles anymore,
g++ gives me errors within the ANTLR include files?

What did you write in the namespace option and what did get generated for
it ?

I have finally gotten permission to release my tree rewrite stuff and

that is just a matter of time.

I'm very happy that we'll be able to access Loring's fixes to the tree 
stuff and his auto tree-grammar generator.  Let's be careful though 
that we don't "taint" antlr's liberal licensing policies.  3.0 will be 
BSD license or equivalent; I'm a bit nervous about not allowing certain 
countries to download 2.8.  Wouldn't want people to think that applies 
to ANTLR in general.

Something like this is one way.

class LTest extends Lexer;

tokens {
  FUNC;
}

VAR : ("plus" ('a'..'z'|'0'..'9')) => ('a'..'z') ('a'..'z'|'0'..'9')*
  | ("plus")=> "plus" {$setType(FUNC);};

WS : ( ' '| '\t' | '\f') { $setType(Token.SKIP); }

>>From what I can tell, there are a few countries--Libya, Sudan, Cuba,
Iran--with whom the US has active sanctions and those are the ones
that might be affected.  In theory, the same restrictions probably
apply to ANTLR now, so this is not really a change.  I don't think

restrictions, but what do I know about trade law?

  There is no practical way to limit distribution of information
  published on the Internet.  I think that even the US government has
  this figured out.  We're all in the same boat.  I have published a
  bunch of wavelet signal processing code that has been used by people
  all over the world.  There is no way that I can stop someone in Iran
  from downloading it and still make it available to someone in
  Wisconsin.

  I know that the IEEE has some issues sending magazines to these
  countries (you could probably add North Korea).  I seem to recall
  that these were cleared up.  As far as I know the only way to really
  get into trouble is for a US citizen to spend US dollars in these
  countries.

  One way you can handle this issue, if you're really worried, is
  include a link that says that "you can't download this stuff if
  you're from a 'bad country'" (And, by the way, I think that some or
  all of the trade restrictions on Lybia have been lifted since they
  came clean about their nuclear program)  Sort of like the adult sites
  that say "You're over 18 right?".

  There are also first amendment issues.  I very much doubt that any
  court would find that the government's interest in prohibiting Iran
  from reading about the Wavelet Lifting Scheme or getting the ANTLR
  parser justifies restricting publication.

  Ian

Thanks for your quick answer.  My question may not have been clear.

I would like VAR to be any string including those starting including
those that start with "plus"  (or another keyword/token) followed by
letters or integers.  so:
  helloWorld ---> VAR
  plus ---> FUNC
  plus1 ---> VAR

In your reply VAR must start with "plus".  Add the origional VAR
defintion ('a'..'z') ('a'..'z'|'0'..'9' | '.')* to the rules below and
you get nondeterminism. 

  VAR : 
    ("plus " ( 'a'..'z'|'0'..'9')) => ('a'..'z') ('a'..'z'|'0'..'9' |
'.')* |
    (('a'..'z') ('a'..'z'|'0'..'9' | '.')*) |
    ("plus ") => "plus " {$setType(FUNC); } ;

There is now nondetermenism between block 2 and 3.  Move the last
block up and "plus1" is labled FUNC again.  Even if this were to work
I have a lot of keywords, defining them WITHIN another token
definition seems bad.

What would be ideal (in my mind) is if I could leave VAR as is and
change FUNC to be something like
  FUNC: "plus" ~( 'a'..'z'|'0'..'9') 
And then have that last charater not be consumed (or re-inject it into

	I've looked at some sample grammars and I seen both:

		someRule
		    : TOKEN^ foo bar
		        {
			    #someRule = #([SOME_RULE,"SOME_RULE",someRule);
			}
		    ;

	and:

		someRule
		    : t:TOKEN^ { #t.setType( SOME_RULE ); } foo bar
		    ;

	(The former seems fairly verbose.)
	Why would you do one over the other?

A lot of thanks Ter, but it doesn't work.
If I appy this code to your template:

vardef.setAttribute("type","int");
vardef.setAttribute("name","i");
vardef.setAttribute("type","char");
vardef.setAttribute("type","c");

I get:
intchar ic;
(newline)

And what I want is 
int i;(newline)
char c;(newline)
(and without using beans)


A lot of thanks in advance for your time Ter,

Hi,

I think that you have to do is use the tokens section of the lexer for
your reserved keywords
(in your case func)

tokens {
    FUNC="func";

}
VAR: ('a'..'z') ('a'..'z'|'0'..'9')*;


Make sure that in VAR you use the testLiterals option to true. This is
the default, but be sure that you haven't put it to false in global
options.

Cheers,

Subject: [antlr-interest] C++ Output file ANTLR 274
Message-ID: <cj0q0b+m4t9@eGroups.com>

Hello everyone,

I was wondering if there was a way to specify the file names when 
using ANTRL.

By default it generates:
dummyLexer.cpp
dummyLexer.hpp
dummyParser.cpp
dummyParser.hpp
dummyTokenTypes.hpp
dummyTokenTypes.txt

and for example I would like to have something like :
dummyTool.cpp (lexer + parser)
dummyTool.h (lexer + parser)
dummyTT.h
dummyTT.txt

To summarize have multiple classes in same files and change file name 
and extension.

Thanks in advance if anyone has an idea.

Cheers,

JC

Message-ID: <62988.194.39.131.39.1096023800.14431.squirrel@server02.webmailer.hosteurope.de>

Hi,
we're using ANTLRs "-docbook" output facility to generate documentation on
the parser/lexer. Because we are using XML DocBook and not SGML DocBook we
have set up a little "toolchain" to transform the generated DocBook.
First we process the SGML with OpenJades "sgml2xml" to get XML files, then
we use an XSLT stylesheet to fix some things within the DocBook XML.

I thought someone else might be interested in this stylesheet too. It
transforms the tagnames to lower case ( "<BOOK>" to "<book>" ) which is
required by XML DocBook. Then it transforms the XML from a <book> with
<section>s to a <reference> with <refentry>s. It also transforms links
whichs linkends don't exist into <literal>s.

Afterwards you should have a somewhat cleaner, semantic XML DocBook file.
I'm attaching the file as it's not really large.

I've never used StringTemplate, but don't you need to somehow flush the

Oh.  Right.  You are setting two parallel arrays essentially.  I have 
no mechanism to walk them at this point (in a really old version I did 
before properties).  Only way is to have it pull from beans and use 
separator.  Are you aware of the

setAttribute("decl.{type,name}", "int", "i");

notation?  It kicks ass.  Dont' have to create your own beans.

Howdy.  All attributes are computed and stored into the template and 
then one final toString() spits it out :)  I specifically tried to 
remove order-of-operation issues so the template is a view not a 
program.

Rooting with an imaginary token is fairly common in rules with many 
alternatives, especially if you are using the tree to preserve some 
semantics.  A glance at my GCC grammar will show some examples of this.

Did the my rooting rules patch get in there?  The definition and
implementation I gave is complete, consistent, and seems intuitive.

I don't understand what you explain above. But  at the finish I solve
the problem with your's under  info.

Yes I'm aware of this notation, and I read about it in the
documentation and also I have done some test to use it but with no
exit.

Finally I apply it well with:

vardef(def)::= <<
<def:{<it.type> <it.name>};separator="\n">
>>

But I think that the documentation is not very clean with this syntax.
Because after read it twice and doing some tests I din't be able to
use it well. Possibly is my poor English but... I think that the
explanation of Automatic aggregate creation is so technical and it is
not explained why you have to use the it.
It's only a suggestion I appreciate a lot your help and your altruist
work doing StringTemplate and documenting it.

A lot of thanks Ter,

Hi,

Sorry about that.  Perhaps the unit tests would help.

Howdy,

When debugging templates particularly for web pages with lots of nested 
templates, printing out the list of attributes you've set with 
setAttribute() is pretty handy.  You could, for example, display the 
contents of all attributes at the bottom of a web page if in "debug" 
mode.  So if you had set two attributes title (a simple string) and 
user (a user-defined object), you might want this info:

Name: title
Type: java.lang.String

Name: user
Type: org.foo.MyUser
Properties: name, email, address, phone

It shows the incoming data not the references in the template.

Seems like this can be easily had by allowing templates to access the 
list of attribute name/value pairs via a reflection method.  We'd want 
this to be on-demand rather than computing a set of reflection 
descriptors each time.  Rather than make a special attribute, we should 
make it something like <self.attributes> which will on demand (when 
rendered) call getAttributes() on "self" (the template object).

<self.attributes> would return not the raw attribute data, but a 
reflection object that describes the key/value pair.  That reflection 
object would let you say:

<self.attributes:{Name: <it.name> Type: <it.type.name> Properties: 
<it.properties>}>

Further you want to be able to be able to recursively walk down to 
embedded templates and get those attributes.  You'd probably want a 
flattened list of all attributes for any particular page.  Perhaps that 
requires <self.embedded> or <self.children> so you can use 
StringTemplate to walk down to those templates. :)

All I have to do is set "self" to be a predefined attribute pointing to 
the surrounding template "this" pointer and all this will just work.  
<self.name> etc... will just work as they are getXXX methods already 
defined.

Hmm...anybody have any suggestions or problems with this approach?

Thanks,
Ter

Ok, I just found an objection.  $x.y$ currently looks up y in the 
attribute table of x if x is a ST.  This is consistent with the use of 
$super.attribute$ and $super.templateRef()$.  Hmm...so $self.name$ 
doesn't work: it looks for attribute name in the attribute list not 
getName() in ST self.  Argh!!!!

Any suggestions?  I don't want to make self special obviously and 
behave differently than any other reference to a template variable.

Perhaps we throw out self and use just a plain attribute reference that 
is special like $attributes$, which you could then walk with ST.  The 
negative is that it would unnecessarily expensive to compute 
"attributes" and have it laying around all the time.   Perhaps it's 
only available in "lint mode", which already exists?

$attributes:{Name: $it.name$ Type: $it.type.name$ 
Properties:$it.properties$}$

Also, what if a an attribute is multi-valued?  Before I had this:

> Name: user
> Type: org.foo.MyUser
> Properties: name, email, address, phone

but what if it's really say 2 users:

Name: users
Type: org.foo.MyUser
Properties: name, email, address, phone
Type: org.foo.MyUser
Properties: name, email, address, phone

oh, i guess ST would handle that automatically with template 
application.

Now, what about properties that have properties.  For example,

Name: student
Type: org.foo.Student
Properties: name, school, ID

where school property is actually an aggregate with properties too or 
worse a ST itself?  You must recurse.  Since this could go 10 levels 
deep, I'm not sure if it's worth digging down into subproperties of 
subproperties etc...

Hi Ter,
I think my data interface definition  file in WebStringTemplates
(www.webstringtemplates.org) addresses this issue.
It uses reflection to output all attributes and their string values in an
html page as Data Definitions
This output can be produced by setting a special control attribute to
"true".
By the way you need a recursion limit to prevent loops, my default is 3
levels but can be modified by setting
another special control attribute to the level required.
My control attributes all include a .  (dot)  and are not valid attributes
for use in a template so there is no
name space clashes.

I have attached a sample output which also shows all the data filters
defined and which one is used to filter each
attribute before supplying it for use in the template.
(http://www.forward.com.au/webstringtemplates/manual/samples/bookstore3Filte
rs.html)

These data interface definition files can also be read back in to initialize
attributes.
See the detailed docs and extensive examples on the web site for more
details.
matthew

P.S. as the name suggests WebStringTemplates was inspired by Ter'
StringTemplates but is biased towards
(but not restricted to) webpages.

WebStringTemplates Data Interface Defintion handles multi-valued attributes
and displays them as ordered lists.
The order number is for the reader's benifit only and in keeping with Ter's
philosophy the template can NOT reference items in
the list by index.

Yup.  I assumed I'd recurse until reflection told me there were no more 
properties of properties.

Thanks...i'll muddle thru with a prototype to see what happens.

Yeah for well defined beans you could just recurse until done but for real
Sun Java objects
they often had references to the parent which referes to the child which
.......  for ever.
Of course you should program defensively anyway and just assume there may be
loops even in user created beans.

Subject: [antlr-interest] Change operator precedence in a AST
Message-ID: <d2d18a10409261204475b5624@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have an AST for my pseudocode language. The idea is to generate a
compiler to java bytecode and for this I haven't any problem because I
have the AST with the correct operator precedence.
But also I want to generate Java code for didactic purposes and the
precedence of the operators isn't the same. How can I change the
precedence of operator of my AST to reflect the operator precedence in
Java.
Someone has some example?

Cheers,

I'm puzzled.  In an AST there isn't really precedence - you just evaluate
bottom-up.  Are you looking for guidance in rewriting/rotate the trees to
reflect a change in precedence?  E.g, something like this?

Given:
	(+ A (* C D))
Produce:
	(* (+ A C) D)

Or are you looking for a stack implementation that will ignore the shape of
the AST and evaluate an expression based on a different set of rules?

Yes, exactly.

The problem is that I generate the AST using the operator's precedence
of my language. But then when I want to use the AST to translate to
the target language I can't use my AST directly to output code because
the priority of operators change. And I don't know how to manage this
easily.

You still can use the AST to generate code--just insert parentheses in
the appropriate spots.

Here's a code extract showing a set of rules applied and part of the
tree processing code implementing those rules.

additive_expression returns [String s]

Subject: [antlr-interest] AST construction from rule
Message-ID: <41583FEE.9060203@yahoo.gr>


I have a problem with the AST constructed from a rule in my TreeParser.
The rule returns a list of AST nodes.
The rule without action code is:
rule
  :
  rule1
  | rule 2
  |!#(DIM (decl:s_decl )+)
  ......
each decl is added to a List and in the end the result of the rule is
created from the elements of that list.
This is the code of AST generations:
## = makeFromList(dimArrays, null);
makeFromList is a method i have implemented
and if I call  ##.toStringList for input:
dim a(12), b()
I get  
( EXPR ( = a array ) ) ( EXPR ( = b array ) )
which is fine.

The problem is that from the 2 nodes, only the first one is kept.
Any idea how to fix this?

Hi Everyone,

This seems like a major anomaly, but I can't see where I

Message-ID: <8DBBDD78-10EE-11D9-9FCD-000A95891192@cs.usfca.edu>

Howdy,

I've a proposal for consuming more newlines automatically.  Almost 
always you want <if> to work as it does:

<if(foo)>
this line
<else>
that line
<endif>

where you get exactly "this line\n" or "that line\n", but not "\nthis 
line\n" and "\nthat line\n" (note that there is in fact a \n after the 
<if(foo)> and before the "this line".  So, i automatically consume any 
\n immediately following an <if> or <else>.  Also, ignore \n after 
<endif> if on line by itself.  So, the following

hi <if(foo)>this<else>that</endif>
ho

gives you either

hi this
ho

or

hi that
ho

There are lots of cases, however, where one wants the \n to be killed 
before the <else> and <endif>.  So

<if(foo)>this<else>that</endif>

would be identical to

<if(foo)>
this
<else>
that
</endif>

which is way more readable for anything but small bits of text.  The 
problem is that sometimes you might want that extra newline as in the 
"this line\n" above.  Here is a real example from the ANTLR 3.0 code 
generator:

<if(LEXER)>
     System.err.println("<description>: no viable alt line "+getLine()+" 
c='"+(char)input.LA(1)+"'");
<else>
     System.err.println("<description>: no viable alt line 
token="+((TokenStream)input).LT(1));
<endif>

You can always get it with an extra line though like this i were to 
change it:

<if(LEXER)>
     System.err.println("<description>: no viable alt line "+getLine()+" 
c='"+(char)input.LA(1)+"'");

<else>
     System.err.println("<description>: no viable alt line 
token="+((TokenStream)input).LT(1));

<endif>

would yield "this\n" or "that\n".

The same goes for the new StringTemplateGroup group file format.  Often 
for clarity I want to put <<...>> template specs on separate lines:

test() ::= <<
fubar
 >>

Often I want "fubar", but I get "fubar\n".

My proposal is thus to be absolutely consistent: kill a single newline 
after <if>, <<, <else>, and <endif> (if on line by itself) as it does 
now.  Then kill newlines *before* <else> and <endif> and >>.  Anybody 
want to comment?

Thanks,
Ter

According to this page (in February 2004), you need Cygwin 1.5.6, or even
1.5.7-1, since 64-bit support is reasonably recent.

Message-ID: <62686.194.39.131.40.1096380386.14431.squirrel@server02.webmailer.hosteurope.de>

Hello,
I'm trying to construct trees from my grammar and have run into two problems:

a) rule: leftExpr ( ( operator1 | operator2 | operator3 ) rightExpr )?

I want to construct a tree from this with whatever results from operator
being the root node of the subtree. Note that operator1-3 are rules, so I
can't write "operator1^". Is there a simple way of solving this? I've
somewhat succeeded with declaring a local variable within the rule and
writing "(o1:operator1 { opnode = #o1; } | o2:operator2 { opnode = #o2 }
...)" and constructing the tree manually afterwards. But this doesn't seem
very clean to me. Is there a better solution?

b) rule: someExpr ( OPERATOR someExpr )*
I want to create a subtree which roots at the first someExpr and all other
someExpr should be a child of the preceding someExpr. I could drag down
the (OPERATOR ...)* rule to someExpr and recurse which would eliminate the
problem with a possibly infinite number of expressions on the right side:

| rule: someExpr
| someExpr: ( the usual stuff ) ( OPERATOR someExpr )?

( The drawback with this method is that the maximum call depth within my
gramamr would get increased by that a lot. I don't know if that will
really be a problem though.) But I don't really know how to get further
from here (I'm getting infinite loops with everything I try). Can anyone
help me with this?

Both of these problems could be easily solved by allowing the caret (^)
operator not only on tokens but also on grammar rules. Is there a specific
reason for not doing this?

Regards,
Martin

I've done this processing the operator<N> in the scanner, rather than
the parser:

	// parser
	rule : left ( OPER_RULE^ rightExpr )?

	// scanner
	protected OPERATOR_1: .... ;
	protected OPERATOR_2: .... ;
	protected OPERATOR_3: .... ;

	OPER_RULE : OPERATOR_1 | OPERATOR_2 | OPERATOR_3 ;

This does require a string comparison to sort out OPERATOR_<N> in the tree,
rather than keying on the type - the tokens returned from the scanner are
all of type OPER_RULE.

Perhaps there are other ways?

I'm guessing here, but I think it's because you don't know the shape of the
tree
for a grammar rule - and therefore you would not know where to attach the
children
if the grammar rule produced a tree rather than a single token.

This seems reasonable but it still results in significant yet unquoted 
whitespace which I abhor.  Maybe you could also allow an explicit 
escaped newline like this for neat-freaks like me.

<if(LEXER)>
      System.err.println("<description>: no viable alt line "+getLine()+"
c='"+(char)input.LA(1)+"'");<\n>
<else>
      System.err.println("<description>: no viable alt line
token="+((TokenStream)input).LT(1));<\n>
<endif>

And yes, I agree that python is awesome. But nevertheless...

Subject: [antlr-interest] testcases for pccts1.33
Message-ID: <41590C4F.9090509@isi.edu>

Hi All,

Does somebody have some example grammar files, with the old syntax for 
grammar files (i.e.,  the syntax used in pccts 1.33) ?

If so please forward me the links/files.
I need to test some stuff I developed based on pccts 1.33.

The release (PCCTS 1.33MR33) contains some examples under 'testcpp' 
directory, but they don't compile.

(or) if somebody has pccts 1.33 code with working examples, that would 
be great.

Thanks & Regards,
-Shiva

Subject: [antlr-interest] unchecked calls warnings compiling the lexer
Message-ID: <200409282059.25201.lucio.biondi@iond.it>

Hi,

antlr generates in myLexer.java :

literals = new Hashtable();
literals.put(new ANTLRHashString("min", this), new Integer(13));
literals.put(new ANTLRHashString("max", this), new Integer(13));
literals.put(new ANTLRHashString("sum", this), new Integer(13));
.....

but javac (1.5) complaints with warnings :

[unchecked] unchecked call to put(K,V) as a member of the raw type java.util.Hashtable
? ? literals.put(new ANTLRHashString("min", this), new Integer(13));

I've found no solution googling this forum and the net.

I need java 1.5 for my project so how can I wrap around this problem
given that antlr seems to me still not ready to produce java code with generics ?

Sorry, I'm not an antlr guru, so probably I miss something.

Thanks in advance.

Lucio

Yep, that is a 1.5 backward incompatibility.

No, you're right.  1.5 issue.  Nothing can be done though until whole

Yoinks!  Certainly it isn't that bad, is it?  Surely the code generation
could be tweaked in some way couldn't it?  I was really looking forward
to using 1.5 with ANTLR.

Well, only way to remove warnings is to add <typename> junk everywhere, 
which of course then won't compile for < 1.5. :(

I wonder if there is a 1.5 option for backward compatibility.  Surely 
Sun did that, right?

Consider using jikes for the files generated by antlr and javac for the rest.
The class files are backward compatible, so there should be no problem in mixing
the two sets of class files.

Hi,

I haven't tested it but the java compiler have this option:

-source release
    Specifies the version of source code accepted. The following
values for release are allowed:
    1.3 	the compiler does not support assertions, generics, or other
language features introduced after JDK 1.3.
    1.4 	the compiler accepts code containing assertions, which were
introduced in JDK 1.4.
    1.5 	the compiler accepts code containing generics and other
language features introduced in JDK 5. The compiler defaults to the
version 5 behavior if the -source flag is not used.
    5 	Synonym for 1.5

Cheers,

Try mixing classes compiled under different source=.. commands.
By that I mean compile Antlr with source=1.4 and for the productions have
calls to your 1.5 code which is contained in another class file which is
compiled under source=1.5

Hi.

I think the "pragma" Chris is referring to is the
@SuppressWarnings("unchecked") annotation which is much talked about but
not yet supported in the Java 1.5 compiler (apparently it will be
supported in 1.5.1). Once this is supported you might be able to add
this annotation to the parser/lexer preamble in your grammar file to
stop the compilation warnings:

{@SupressWarnings("unchecked")}
class YourParserClass extends Parser;
...
...

But until this happens or until Antlr supports generating Java 1.5 code
the only simple option is to put up with the warning. While it would be
nice not to have to worry about spurious warning messages, the one
identified is far from fatal and won't stop you from developing with
Antlr under Java 1.5. The warning in question simply indicates that the
generic method "put" on Hashtable has been called in a non-generic
fashion.

Joan also refers to the -source option of the Javac compiler. If your
grammar file was fairly self contained and had no use of generics or
other 1.5 language features, you could conceivably compile ONLY the
generated lexer/parser code using the "-source 1.4" option, then compile
the rest of your project (presumably using 1.5 language features) using
"-source 1.5" and then package all the class files together. This will
stop warning messages and should work well thanks to JVM/javac backward
compatibility with older class file versions, but depending on your
project and its class/package coupling it may not be that easy to do.

Michael.

John,
I posted the cantlr.exe file since it seemed like to good way to help
people out, but I was not aware of all the dependency problems that
cygwin has and in practise, this file seems to create more problems
than it solves.

If you have cygwin already installed with a GCC that supports the JAVA
compiler GCJ, I suggest that you simply recompile cantlr from scratch.
There is page on the website that describes how to do this.

Terence, 
obviously, I can't know how many people do not have problems with this
file, but maybe it should simple be dropped? If people have to install
cygwin already anyway, it's only a small step to create an executable
by following the instructions.
Tom

I want to set the enumeration value of RW_VECTOR explicitly, not have
it set based on the order it appears in the tokens section. I
understand that values less than 4 are reserved by ANTLR.

Message-ID: <cjfiji+qdub@eGroups.com>

Thanks, I knew there had to be an easy way. Unfortunately, I think
your answer uncovered a bug in ANTLR (or is it just uncovering my
ignorance).

I want function names to be mapped to tokens because I am defining my
own AST classes.  So my token definition looked like:

  tokens {
    FUNC<AST=my.ast.here>;
  }

So according to my reading of the ANTRL docs I should be able to do this:

  tokens {
    FUNC="func"<AST=my.ast.Class>;
  }

Problem is that is generates parser code that looks like this:

    protected void buildTokenTypeASTClassMap(){
        tokenTypeToASTClassMap.put(new Integer("func"), my.ast.Class);
    }

Which of course causes an exception when java tries to make an integer
out of the string "func."

So, before I report this as a bug:
  I doing something wrong or is this an ANTLR bug?
  If this is a bug to whom do I report it?




BTW, Right now the only working solution I've found is a very tedious
semantic predicate:

  VAR : {FunctionTests.isFunc(LA(1), LA(2), LA(3), LA(4))}? 
('a'..'z') ('a'..'z'|'0'..'9')* { $setType(FUNC) ;} |
('a'..'z') ('a'..'z'|'0'..'9')* ;

Which isn't a very good solution at all.

Put your token enumeration in a separate ...TokenTypes.txt file and
use importVocab to reference it.

Hi,
 
I want the tree structure as follows:
 
Nice  
     |
     |--15
 
My code is as follows:

opt_pri! :#(PRI priVal)

{

#opt_pri = #([NICE, "nice"], #priVal); 

}

;



priVal! : INT

{

#priVal = #[INT,"-15"];

}

;

 
Am getting the following error:

java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem: 

priVal cannot be resolved

How i can resolve this error? Is there is any other way?

Thanks.

Best regards,

Lakshmi

Have a look at the generated code.  is there a variable declaration 
missing or something?  Nothing is obviously wrong from what I see.

How's about this, which I use for recognizing user-defined type names:

	VAR : ('a'..'z') ('a'..'z'|'0'..'9')*
		{ if (FunctionTests.isFunc($getText)) { $setType(FUNC); } }

Hope this helps,

I have problems sometimes when I don't use "#" everywhere, so
you might try changing from this
	#( [NICE, "nice"], #priVal)
to this
	#( #[NICE, "nice"], #priVal)

Subject: [antlr-interest] Pb with tree walker
Message-ID: <cjhht8+kg64@eGroups.com>

New to antlr, I am trying some examples of tree walking; I got some trouble with this
simple one which prints an AST:

imprimerArbre[int indent]:
	#( nc:.	
			{ 	for(int i=1;i<=indent*3; i++)
					cout<<' ';
				cout<<nc->getText()<<endl;
			}
			( imprimerArbre[indent+1] )*
	) 	
	;

As I hoped "toStringList" prints the true AST:

 ( Foret ( Arbre ( Structure ( 1 ( 2 3 4 ) ) ) ( Decoration ( FORME ' ' ) ( UL 'ULTXT' ) ) ( 
Decoration ( FORME 'ANLAGEKOSTEN' ) ( KSY GN ) ) ( Decoration ( FORME ' ' ) ( UL '.' ) ) ( 
Decoration ( FORME 'ANLAGEKOSTEN' ) ( SF GOV ) ) ) )

and "ImprimerArbre" only prints:

   Foret
      Arbre
         Structure
            1
               2
                  3
                  4

and not the siblings of the node Structure (ie the Decoration subtrees).  And the sibling of
3 is printed !

Thanks a lot,
Jean-Claude.

Hi,
 
I tried in the same way as Bryan suggested. 
 
Now am getting two errors:
 
1. priVal cannot be resolved
2. The method create() in the Type ASTFactory is not applicable for the arguments(AST,String)
 
Is the priVal rule needs the change?
 
Thanks.
 
Best Regards,
Lakshmi

I have problems sometimes when I don't use "#" everywhere, so
you might try changing from this
#( [NICE, "nice"], #priVal)
to this
#( #[NICE, "nice"], #priVal)

In .java file,
 
priVal_AST = (AST)astFactory.make( (new ASTArray(1)).add(astFactory.create(tmp12_AST,"-15")));
 
The errors is on the create(tmp12_AST,"-15").  The errror "The method create() in the ASTFactory is not applicable for the arguments(AST,String)" occurs.
 
Because of this error, the following error occurs for priVal as it is not being recognised:

opt_pri_AST = (AST)astFactory.make( (new ASTArray(2)).add(astFactory.create(NICE,"nice")).add(priVal)); 
Here it is not able to recognise priVal and the error "priVal cannot be resolved" occurs.
Also i observed that '!' mark doesn't matter.   
 
Rule on priVal needs any change?
 
Current code:
 

opt_pri! :#(PRI priVal)

{

#opt_pri = #(#[NICE, "nice"], #priVal); 

}

;



priVal! : INT

{

#priVal = #([INT,"-15"]);

}

;

One other problem I've had is that "!" disables construction of the subtrees.  Try removing the "!" after the rule name.  This is just a guess, but it follows the pattern of what I've been seeing in my code.
 
I'm using ANTLR to generate C++, by the way; I don't think it'd be different for java, but just in case....

Perfect!  Thank you.

I think the best way would be if I could use literals (with an AST
option) in the token definition of the lexer but this a great work around.

This is a problem I have faced many times.
The workaround for this is:
int intType = INT;
#priVal = #([intType, "-15"]);

If this behaver is a feature of Antlr, I wish it's removed.
