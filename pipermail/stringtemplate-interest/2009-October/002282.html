<PRE>Hi everyone,

 

Here's a status update that I know many people are asking for. For each
portion, I'll talk about the status of the code in Perforce. At the end,
I'll talk about the status of the posted binaries.

 

Basic Status

 

StringTemplate and the ANTLR Tool: Up-to-date with the Java version for
all targets as of August 4, 2009, which covers all of the changes made
earlier in the year and over the summer.

 

CSharp3 Target: working and extensively used in the ANTLR Tool,
StringTemplate, and the commercial projects I use ANTLR for. I haven't
tested the -profile and -debug modes because I don't use them, however
the templates should be &quot;close to working&quot;. Currently, the CSharp3
target can only be used when generating grammars from the C# port of the
tool.

 

Design Changes

 

1.       Rather than package the target templates as resources in the
tool's executable, I've chosen a flat file layout. That way, the
templates for a target can be updated without recompiling the tool. The
targets themselves are also implemented as individual DLL's.

2.       The CSharp3 target declares rules as private methods by
default. Rules can be made public by simply marking them as such in the
grammar: &quot;public compile_unit : declaration*;&quot; I have updated the Java
target's code generation to support this as well, but it's not checked
in.

3.       StringTemplate has code for a high speed dynamically compiled
interpreter. By default, the build doesn't enable this mode, but when
it's turned on the output appears to work correctly. I need to do
another round of tests, but at this point the C# ports of the ANTLR Tool
and StringTemplate should be significantly faster than the Java version.
We've hit a brick wall preventing further optimization without rewriting
ST, but the work on STv4 should give another order of magnitude
improvement in template rendering performance.

 

Things Holding Me Up

 

1.       I haven't finalized the way I'm going to do assembly
versioning, although I think I've got that worked out now. I'll send a
separate mail to the list regarding this.

2.       StringTemplate is only tested in regards to code generation for
the ANTLR tool. In particular, its ability to locate templates in
resources or on the file system is not documented and may or may not
behave as people expect.

3.       I'm still making periodic changes to the API as I finalize
things, and breaking changes in production code aren't good. I don't
want to suggest replacing the CSharp2 target until the CSharp3 target is
more tested by other people.

 

Things I want to do, but not really holding up the builds

 

I really want to package a clean integration of ANTLR+CSharp3 for
MSBuild. We need this. This would include at least MSBuild targets file
and templates for adding grammars to a project. Unfortunately, there are
many issues I still need to resolve for this to be a reality, most of
which have answers in shades of gray.

 

Status of the Posted Build

 

The build available for download was uploaded on fairly short notice.
Mistakes (by me) included not having the assembly version set correctly
and not posting the source code from the build with the binaries. I've
been trying to wrap some of these things up before posting another
build.
