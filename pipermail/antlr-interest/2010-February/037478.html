<PRE>Ter,

That performance/reference leak checker that we were given licenses for as opensource dudes is really bloody good. Paste in a nice big grammar and keep generating code and editing. You should find the issues pretty quickly with that. It integrates really well with Netbeans so I assume it also integrates well with your IDE too.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I have noticed with ANTLRWorks. The first version I started with
</I>&gt;<i> didn't seem to have the performance and stability problems. My current
</I>&gt;<i> version 1.3.1 does have them. I think I went through two semi-automatic
</I>&gt;<i> upgrades (Two notifications that upgrades were available which I
</I>&gt;<i> naturally accepted.) This version checks for ANTLR syntax errors with
</I>&gt;<i> every keystroke, which I don't recall for my first version. So I would
</I>&gt;<i> definitely check out recent changes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The slowdown takes a while to appear. I think I have it more often when
</I>&gt;<i> I am working with the string template generator files than with my
</I>&gt;<i> large toy grammar, but I have definitely seen it with both. FWIW my
</I>&gt;<i> suspicion is a memory leak, but there are other possibilities. I
</I>&gt;<i> believe there was talk a few months ago of using Java's unbuffered IO
</I>&gt;<i> as the default for ANTLR itself, which can have serious performance
</I>&gt;<i> problems, but I suspect is not the cause here. Java's poor default hash
</I>&gt;<i> function could also be a contributor, but that suspicion could just be
</I>&gt;<i> because I am reading Valloud's text, and he has strong opinions on that
</I>&gt;<i> topic.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jean and I are re-factoring ANTLRWorks to be much simpler in
</I>&gt;<i> anticipation of me taking over maintenance and adding features. The
</I>&gt;<i> first thing I want to do is find out why AW sometimes slows to a crawl.
</I>&gt;<i> I can't seem to reproduce it when I want to, although it was really
</I>&gt;<i> really slow the other day before I decided to debug it! ;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, I need your help to figure out when it occurs so that it will
</I>&gt;<i> give me a clue about where to look in the source code.   My impression
</I>&gt;<i> is that one of the triggers seems to be when there are lots of errors.
</I>&gt;<i> But, when I added a whole bunch of grammar windows and then started
</I>&gt;<i> randomly inserting errors all over the grammar, memory usage didn't
</I>&gt;<i> really go up and it didn't slow down at all (lots other errors to the
</I>&gt;<i> console, but that's it). I wonder though if it was getting more memory
</I>&gt;<i> available to it in the debugger than when I run it from the jar file.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I note that sometimes undo is extremely slow, so that is also a
</I>&gt;<i> potential area to look.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My current candidates for slowdown:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * running out of memory and thrashing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * undo mechanism is tracking too much or something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * error mechanism somehow  tracks too much or has too much work to do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Each keystroke triggers colorizing the editor window, but Jean tells
</I>&gt;<i> me he's sure that the parser itself is okay. might be the error
</I>&gt;<i> handling though.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can anybody reproduce a case where you start ANTLRWorks and then do
</I>&gt;<i> some stuff in the editor window with a grammar (of any size) and it
</I>&gt;<i> starts to get really slow to type? Even if you can't send me your
</I>&gt;<i> grammar, I can send you an instrumented version of AW that will turn
</I>&gt;<i> out some information about what is going on.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks! This is my highest priority for AW since I'm using it to
</I>&gt;<i> build v4 ANTLR.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks,
