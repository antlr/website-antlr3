released!

 

	Hi Jean,

	Please excuse the abruptness of my previous two postings.

	AntlrWorks is a great concept and I am looking forward to its
first full release.

	 

 

I don't expect positive comments, but I prefer when negative ones come
with constructive comments ;-)

 

Concerning the coloring, I have no problem on my laptop (and Terence on
his box) with many grammar files. I would be really happy if you could
send me the grammar file which is causing these problems - it will help
me to reproduce them (I have received some complains about the syntax
coloring, but when I ask for an concrete example, I never get back an
answer).

 

Jean,

 

As I posted earlier, the syntax highlighting and the editor (such as
goto line) are incorrect when the source files is from a Windows editor
and has \r\n for the end of line marker. The syntax highlighting is out
by one character position for each line in the file for what should be
obvious reasons ;-). It no doubt works fine on Unix and MAC :-)

 

Jim
