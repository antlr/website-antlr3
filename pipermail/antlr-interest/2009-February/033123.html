<PRE>Thanks for the reply, but I'm actually not trying to create an
interpreter...my goal is to create a simple scripting language that I can
just translate into C and compile with GCC.  My question may have been
confusing because I was asking about a language similar to C, but really any
grammar with the features I listed below would probably work. 

Thanks

There is already a very nice C interpreter out there you might want to look
at see <A HREF="http://chscite.sourceforge.net/">http://chscite.sourceforge.net/</A>

Subject: [antlr-interest] Is this the correct use of ANTLR

Hi all,

I'm trying to create a simple scripting language that looks similar to C but
I don't actually need to implement an interpreter.   I just want to convert
this &quot;ultra-simple C&quot; subset language into basic C and then run it through
GCC to create an executable.  Is it easier to start with say an ANSI C
grammar and cut out what I don't need or actually find a more simple
programming language?  I really just want mathematical expressions,
functions defined within the file, if/else if/else, and loops  (while, for,
foreach).

My end goal is to be able to take a user's script file, process it, add the
required integration fluff and then create a .o I can link into my
application.

I'm a total newbie when it comes to this stuff so I apologize in advance for
the basic question.

Thanks

</PRE>
