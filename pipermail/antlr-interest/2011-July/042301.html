Hi Sam,

Thanks for the info.  I had seen both of those, but they are too heavyweight
for my needs - the editor must be a HTML5 construct.  Shipping any desktop
tool is a no-no as this is a web-application.

Regarding &quot;You probably shouldn't try to create a new solution in this area.
I've been
working on IDEs for the past several years, and I can tell the task is
nowhere near as straightforward as it seems.&quot;

Not sure what to think of that - there are quite a few assumptions in there
:<i>).  I shall take it as a friendly warning of &quot;here be dragons&quot; as I am sure
</I>that is the intent.

Unfortunately I don't see any other option.  We have decided that a DSL is
the right way forward  for allowing clients to describe their reality to our
tool (previously it was through a chinese-whispers process of spreadsheets
into spreadsheets which we parsed and populated templates in the persistent
store - *that* is nowhere near as straightforward as it seems :)), and we
have decided that ANTLR is the right tool to allow us to build the DSL.

I am surprised that there isn't more traffic in this area - I would have
thought my use-case is very common.  If it is, then how do others allow
clients to build non-trivial documents conforming to a grammar defined in
ANTLR?

If I do have to do this from scratch then I expect I shall:

 - define an abstraction for the things the editor cares about (current
errors, ability to identify context based on cursor position, safe
suggestions for example)
 - provide an implementation that is hard coded for one document in the
first instance
 - dive into the internals in the second instance to see how much I can grab
from the ANTLR internals of the generated tokeniser and parser in the second
instance

Creating a HTML5 construct to appear to work is pretty trivial I expect (and
I cannot believe it hasn't already been done).  I see the 2nd and 3rd points
above being the can-of-worms, particularly the ability to figure out the
relevant part of the grammar that matches the place in the document the user
is currently editing.

With respect, I see it as non-trivial, but not un-doable.  It would make a
nice open-source project as well....

Thanks for the help - I don't mean to be dismissive - keep the ideas coming
:<i>)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the products we develop use documents which are parsed by ANTLR to
</I>&gt;<i> describe the real world to the application.  These are none-trivial and
</I>&gt;<i> need
</I>&gt;<i> to be internally consistent.  Some of these documents (not the grammar) can
</I>&gt;<i> run into hundreds of pages and asking people to edit them via notepad or a
</I>&gt;<i> HTML text area is, er, well, not the best :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have had a quick search for a tool to help write documents (that conform
</I>&gt;<i> to the grammar - *not* the grammar itself!) but came to the conclusion that
</I>&gt;<i> I am going to have to write my own.  The requirements I have are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - auto-suggest for syntactically valid constructs
</I>&gt;<i>  - auto-suggest for semantically valid constructs (for example, if the
</I>&gt;<i> first
</I>&gt;<i> part of the grammar defines a list of Xs then when a X is referred to later
</I>&gt;<i> on it should auto-suggest an X, even if the construct for referring to X is
</I>&gt;<i> quoted text)
</I>&gt;<i>  - line and character high-lighting of syntactical or semantical
</I>&gt;<i> validations
</I>&gt;<i>  - and so on....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Catching and identifying the location of syntax errors is pretty trivial (
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://yatesco.wordpress.com/2011/07/15/capturing-line-numbers-from-antlr-pa">http://yatesco.wordpress.com/2011/07/15/capturing-line-numbers-from-antlr-pa</A>
</I>&gt;<i> rsing-errors/&lt;<A HREF="http://yatesco.wordpress.com/2011/07/15/capturing-line-numbers-from-antlr-parsing-errors/">http://yatesco.wordpress.com/2011/07/15/capturing-line-numbers-from-antlr-parsing-errors/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> ),
</I>&gt;<i> but that is just the start. One big issue is that there needs to be an API
</I>&gt;<i> that executes *very* quickly of the form:
</I>&gt;<i> List&lt;Suggestion&gt; calculateSuggestions(String currentWordFragment, int line,
</I>&gt;<i> int character) to retrieve a list of syntacticly and semantically correct
</I>&gt;<i> words.  To figure that out, there needs to be a way of identifying which
</I>&gt;<i> bits of grammar that position in the document has.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want to write one editor specific to each grammar, rather I want to
</I>&gt;<i> abstract the required information into a generic library with one
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of ANTLR.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I cannot, I just cannot believe I am the first person to want to do
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, a couple of questions - is there anything already out there that will
</I>&gt;<i> do
</I>&gt;<i> this?  Would using an intermediate form tree, rather than constructing my
</I>&gt;<i> own internal representation help (I can't see that it would)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another way of asking is is &quot;how do I use ANTLRWorks for documents that
</I>&gt;<i> conform to a grammar rather than the grammar itself&quot; :)
